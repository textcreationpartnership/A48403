            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A NEW HISTORICAL RELATION OF THE KINGDOM OF SIAM. The Occaſion and Deſign of this Work.</head>
                  <p>AT my return from the Voyage I made to <hi>Siam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Occaſion of this work.</note> in quality of his Most Chriſtian Majeſties Envoy Extraordinary, they whoſe right it is to command, requir'd me to render them an exact account of the things, which I had ſeen or learnt in that Country; which will be the whole matter of this work. Others have ſufficiently informed the Public of the Circumſtances of this long Voyage: But as to what concerns the Deſcription of a Country, we cannot have too many Relations, if we would perfectly know it: the laſt always illuſtrating the former. But that it may be known from what time I write, I ſhall declare only that we ſet Sail from <hi>Breſt</hi> on the Firſt of <hi>March, Anno 1687.</hi> That we caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the Road of <hi>Siam</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the ſame Year. That we departed thence for our return the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>January, 1688.</hi> And that we landed at <hi>Breſt</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>My Deſign is therefore to treat firſt of the Country of <hi>Siam,</hi> its Extent,<note place="margin">The Deſign of this work.</note>
Fertility, and the qualities of its Soil and Climate: Secondly, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the manners of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> in general, and then their particular Cuſtoms according to their various Qualities. Their Government and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall be comprehended in the laſt part; and I flatter my ſelf that the farther the Reader ſhall advance in the peruſal of this work, the more he will find it worthy of Curioſity; by reaſon that the Nature and Genius of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> which I have every where endeavoured to penetrate into, will be diſcovered more and more: In fine, not to ſtay on things, which would not pleaſe every one, or which would interrupt my Narrative too much, I will at the end inſert ſeveral Memoirs which I brought from this Country,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98501:4"/>
and which I cannot ſuppreſs without injuring the Curioſity of the Public. But if notwithſtanding this precaution, I do yet enlarge on certain matters beyond the reliſh of ſome, I intreat them to conſider that general expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do never afford just Idea's; and that this is to proceed no farther than the ſuperficial Knowledge of things. 'Tis out of this deſire of making the <hi>Siameſes</hi> perfectly known, that I give ſeveral notices of the other Kingdoms of the <hi>Indies</hi> and of <hi>China:</hi> For though rigorouſly taken, all this may appear foreign to my Subject, yet to me it ſeems that the Compariſon of the things of Neighbouring Countries with each other, does greatly illuſtrate them. I hope alſo that a pardon will be granted me for the <hi>Siameſe</hi> names, which I relate and explain. Theſe remarks will make other relations intelligible as well as mine, which without theſe Illuſtrations might ſometimes cauſe a doubt concerning what I aſſert.</p>
                  <p>In a word, thoſe with whom I am acquainted do know that I love the Truth; but it is not ſufficient to give a ſincere relation to make it appear true: 'Tis requiſite to add clearneſs to ſincerity, and to be thoroughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of that wherein we undertake to instruct others. I have therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, interrogated, and penetrated, as far as it was poſſible; and to render my ſelf more capable of doing it, I carefully read over, before my arrival at <hi>Siam,</hi> ſeveral Antient and Modern Relations of divers Countreys of the East. So that in my opinion this preparation has ſupplied the defect of a longer reſidence, and has made me to remark and underſtand in the three Months I was at <hi>Siam,</hi> what I could not perhaps have underſtood or remark'd in three Years, without the aſſiſtance and peruſal of thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Geographical Deſcription.</head>
                     <p>NAvigation has ſufficiently made known the Sea Coaſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and many Authors have deſcribed them;<note place="margin">How much this Kingdom is unknown.</note> but they know almoſt nothing of the Inland Country, becauſe the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have not made a Map of their Country, or at leaſt know how to keep it ſecret. That which I here preſent is the work of an <hi>European,</hi> who went up the <hi>Menam,</hi> the principal River of the Country, to the Frontiers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but was not skilful enough to give all the Poſitions with an entire exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beſides he has not ſeen all; and therefore I thought it neceſſary to give his Map to Mr. <hi>Caſſini,</hi> Director of the Obſervatory at <hi>Paris,</hi> to correct it by ſome Memorials which were given me at <hi>Siam.</hi> Nevertheleſs I know it to be ſtill defective; but yet it fails not to give ſome notices of this Kingdom which were never heard of, and of being more exact in thoſe we already have:</p>
                     <p>Its Frontiers extend Northward to the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Degree, or thereabouts;<note place="margin">Its Frontiers Northward.</note> and the Road which terminates the Gulph of <hi>Siam,</hi> being almoſt at the Latitude of 13 degrees and a half, it follows, that this whole extent, of which we hardly have any knowledge, runs about 170 Leagues in a direct Line, reckoning 20 Leagues to a degree of Latitude, after the manner of our Seamen.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſay that the City of <hi>Chiamai</hi> is fifteen days journey more to the North, than the Frontiers of their Kingdom, that is to ſay at moſt,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Chiamai</hi> and its Lake.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſixty and ſeventy Leagues; for they are Journeys by water, and againſt the Stream. 'Tis about thirty years ſince their King, as they report, took this City, and abandon'd it, after having carried away all the People; and it has been ſince repeopled by the King of <hi>Ava,</hi> to whom <hi>Pegu</hi> does at preſent render Obedience. But the <hi>Siameſes</hi> which were at that expedition, do not know that famous Lake, from whence our Geographers make the River <hi>Menam</hi> ariſe, and to which, according to them, this City gives its Names: which makes me to think either that it is more diſtant than our Geographers have conceived, or that there is no ſuch Lake. It may alſo happen that this City adjoyning to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kingdoms, and being more ſubject than another to be ruined by War, has not always been rebuilt in the ſame place: And this is not difficult to imagine of the Cities which are built only with wood, as all in theſe Countreys are, and which in their deſtruction leave not any Ruines nor Foundations. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be doubted, whether the <hi>Menam</hi> ſprings from a Lake, by reaſon it is ſo ſmall at its entrance into the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> that for about fifty Leagues, it carries only little Boats capable of holding no more than four or five Perſons at moſt.</p>
                     <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> is bounded from the Eaſt to the North by high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which ſeparate it from the Kingdom of <hi>Laos,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Country of <hi>Siam</hi> is only a Valley.</note> and on the North and Weſt by others, which divide it from the Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Ava.</hi> This double Chain of Mountains (inhabited by a few, ſavage, and poor, but yet free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Life is innocent) leaves between them a great Valley, containing in ſome places between fourſcore and an hundred Leagues in bredth, and is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98501:6"/>
from the City of <hi>Chiamai</hi> to the Sea, that is to ſay from the North to the South, with an excellent River which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> call <hi>Me-nam,</hi> or <hi>Mother-water,</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>a great water,</hi> which being encreaſed by the Brooks and Rivers it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives on every ſide, from the Mountains I have mentioned, diſcharges it ſelf at laſt into the Gulph of <hi>Siam</hi> by three months, the moſt navigable of which is that toward the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cities ſeated on the River.</note>On this River, and about ſeven Miles from the Sea, is ſeated the City of <hi>Bancok:</hi> and I ſhall tranſiently declare, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have very few habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on their Coaſts, which are not far diſtant from thence; but are almoſt all ſeated on Rivers navigable enough to afford them the Commerce of the Sea. As to the names of moſt of theſe places, which for this reaſon may be called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime, they are diſguiſed by Foreigners. Thus the City of <hi>Bancok</hi> is called <hi>Fon</hi> in <hi>Siameſe,</hi> it not being known from whence the name of <hi>Bancok</hi> is derived, altho there be ſeveral <hi>Siameſe</hi> Names, that begin with the word <hi>Ban,</hi> which ſignifies a Village.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Gardens of <hi>Bancok.</hi>
                        </note>The Gardens which are in the Territory of <hi>Bancok,</hi> for the ſpace of four Leagues, in aſcending towards the City of <hi>Siam</hi> to a place named <hi>Talacoan,</hi> do ſupply this City with the Nouriſhment which the Natives of the Country love beſt, I mean a great quantity of Fruit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Other Cities on the <hi>Menam.</hi>
                        </note>The other principal places which the <hi>Menam</hi> waters, are, <hi>Me-Tac</hi> the firſt City of the Kingdom to the North North-Weſt, and then ſucceſſively <hi>Tian-Tong, Campeng pet</hi> or <hi>Campeng</hi> ſimple, which ſome do pronounce <hi>Campingue, Laconcevan, Tchainat, Siam, Talacoan, Talaqueou,</hi> and <hi>Bancok.</hi> Between the two Cities of <hi>Tchainat</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> and at a diſtance, which the Maeanders of the River do render almoſt equal from each other, the River leaves the City of <hi>Louvo</hi> a little to the Eaſt, at the 14 d. 42 m. 32 S. of Latitude, according to the obſervations which the Jeſuites have publiſhed. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> does there ſpend the greateſt part of the year, the more commodiouſly to enjoy the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Hunting: but <hi>Louvo</hi> would not be habitable, were it not for a channel cut from the River to water it. The City of <hi>Me-Tac</hi> renders obedience to an Hereditary Lord, who, they ſay, is a Vaſſal to the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Paya-Tac,</hi> or Prince of <hi>Tac. Tian-Tong</hi> is ruin'd, doubtleſs by the Ancient Wars of <hi>Pegu. Campeng</hi> is known by the Mines of excellent Steel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Another River likewiſe called <hi>Menam.</hi>
                        </note>At the City of <hi>Laconcevan</hi> the <hi>Menam</hi> receives another conſiderable River which comes alſo from the North, and is likewiſe called <hi>Menam,</hi> a name common to all great Rivers. Our Geographers make it to ſpring from the Lake of <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai:</hi> but it is certain that it hath its ſource in the Mountains, which lye not ſo much to the North as this City. It runs firſt to <hi>Meuang-fang,</hi> then to <hi>Pitchiai, Pitſanoulouc,</hi> and <hi>Pitchit,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>Laconcevan,</hi> where it mixes, as I have ſaid with the other River.</p>

                        <hi>Pitſanoulouc,</hi> which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> do corruptly call <hi>Porſelouc</hi> has formerly had hereditary Lords, like the City of <hi>Me-Tac:</hi> and Juſtice is at preſent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the Palace of the Ancient Princes.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laconcevan</hi> ſtands about the mid-way from <hi>Pitſanoulouc</hi> or <hi>Porſelouc</hi> to <hi>Siam,</hi> a diſtance computed to be Twenty five days Journey, for thoſe that go up the River in a Boat or <hi>Balon;</hi> but this voyage may be performed in twelve days when they have a great many Rowers, and they aſcend the River with ſpeed.</p>

The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do give this title to the Sun and Moon, but they do alſo give it to <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to their Kings, and ſome conſiderable Officers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prabat</hi> is therefore the print of a mans foot,<note place="margin">What it is.</note> cut by an ill Graver upon a Rock; but this impreſſion containing about 13 or 14 inches in depth, is five or ſix times as long as a man's Foot, and proportionably as broad. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> adore it, and are perſwaded that the Elephants, eſpecially the white ones, the Rhinoceros, and all the other Beaſts of their Woods, do likewiſe go to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it when no perſon is there; And the King of <hi>Siam</hi> himſelf goes to adore it once a year with a great deal of Pomp and Ceremony. It is covered with a Plate of Gold, and incloſed in a Chappel which is there built. They report that this Rock which is now very flat and like a new mown Field, was formerly a very high Mountain, which ſhrunk and waxed level on a ſudden under the Foot of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> in memory of whom they believe that the Impreſſion of the Foot does there remain. Nevertheleſs it is certain by the Teſtimony of ancient men, that the Antiquity of this Tradition exceeds not 90 years. A <hi>Talapoin,</hi> or Religious <hi>Siameſe,</hi> of that time, having doubtleſs made this Impreſſion himſelf, or procured it to be made, and then feigned to have miraculouſly diſcovered it; and without any other appearance of Truth, gave Reputation and Credit to this Fable of the levell'd Mountain.</p>
                     <p>Now in all this the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are only groſs Imitators.<note place="margin">The Original of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</note> In the Hiſtories of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dia</hi> it is related, with what reſpect a King of the Iſland of <hi>Ceylon</hi> kept an Apes Tooth, which the <hi>Indians</hi> averred to be a Relique, and with what Sums he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to purchaſe and ranſom it from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> of <hi>Brigantium,</hi> then Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of the <hi>Indies,</hi> who had found it amongſt the Spoils taken from the <hi>Indians:</hi> But <hi>Constantine</hi> choſe rather to burn it, and afterwards throw the Aſhes into a River. 'Tis known likewiſe that in the ſame Iſland of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do call <hi>Lanca,</hi> and on a real Mountain which is not levelled, there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended print of a Man's foot, which has for a long time been in great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. It doubtleſs repreſents the Left foot: For the <hi>Siameſes</hi> report that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſet his right foot on their <hi>Prabat,</hi> and his left on <hi>Lanca;</hi> altho the whole Gulph of <hi>Bengala</hi> runs between them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have called the Print at <hi>Ceylon Adam</hi>'s Foot,<note place="margin">What the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s foot of <hi>Ceylon</hi> is.</note> and believe that <hi>Ceylon</hi> was the Terreſtrial Paradiſe, from the Faith of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Ceylon,</hi> who declare that the Impreſſion which they reverence, is the Print of the firſt Man: Every one of theſe Heatheniſh Nations vigorouſly aſſerting that the firſt Man inhabited their Country.

                        </note>ON the Frontiers of <hi>Pegu</hi> is ſeated the City of <hi>Cambory,</hi> and on the borders of <hi>Laos</hi> the Town of <hi>Corazema,</hi> which ſome do call <hi>Cariſſima,</hi> both very Famous. And in the Lands which lie between the Rivers above the City of <hi>Laconcevan,</hi> and on the Channels which have a Communication from one River to the other, there are two other conſiderable Cities, <hi>Socotai,</hi> almoſt in the ſame Latitude with <hi>Pitchit,</hi> and <hi>Sanquelouc</hi> more to the North.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Countrey interſected with Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. The City of <hi>Siam</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note>The Country being ſo hot that it is inhabitable only near Rivers, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have cut a great many Channels; and without having better Memoirs or Notes, 'tis impoſſible to reckon up all the Cities ſeated thereon.</p>
                     <p>'Tis by the means of theſe Channels, called by the <hi>Siameſes Cloum,</hi> that the City of <hi>Siam</hi> is not only become an Iſland, but is placed in the middle of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Iſlands, which renders the ſituation thereof very ſingular. The Iſle wherein it is ſituated, is at preſent all incloſed within its walls, which certainly was not in the time of <hi>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto;</hi> if notwithſtanding the continual miſtakes of this Author, who ſeems to rely too much on his memory, we may believe what he ſays, that the Elephants of the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who then beſieged the City of <hi>Siam,</hi> did ſo nearly approach the Walls, as with their Trunks to beat down the Paliſado's which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> had there placed to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Its Latitude, according to Father <hi>Thomas</hi> the Jeſuit, is 14 d. 20 m. 40 S. and its Longitude 120 d. 30 m. It has almoſt the figure of a Purſe, the mouth of which is to the Eaſt, and the bottom to the Weſt. The River meets it at the North by ſeveral Channels, which run into that which environs it; and leaves it on the South, by ſeparating itſelf again into ſeveral ſtreams. The King's Palace ſtands to the North on the Canal which embraces the City; and by turning to the Eaſt, there is a Cauſey, by which alone, as by an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> People may go out of the City without croſſing the water.</p>
                     <p>The City is ſpacious, conſidering the Circuit of its Walls, which, as I have ſaid, incloſes the whole Iſle; but ſcarce the ſixth part thereof is inhabited, and that to the South-Eaſt only. The reſt lies deſart, where the Temples only ſtand. 'Tis true that the Suburbs, which are poſſeſſed by ſtrangers, do conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably increaſe the number of the People. The ſtreets thereof are large and ſtrait, and in ſome places planted with Trees, and paved with Bricks laid edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The Houſes are low, and built with Wood; at leaſt thoſe belonging to the Natives, who, for theſe Reaſons, are expoſed to all the Inconveniences of the exceſſive heat. Moſt of the ſtreets are watered with ſtrait Canals, which have made <hi>Siam</hi> to be compar'd to <hi>Venice,</hi> and on which are a great many ſmall Bridges of Hurdles, and ſome of Brick very high and ugly.</p>

'Tis about the Latitude of this Cape, that the Gulph of <hi>Siam</hi> begins; and the Kingdom of this Name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a great way towards the South in form of an Horſeſhoe on either ſide of the Gulph, <hi>viz.</hi> along the Eaſtern Coaſt to the River <hi>Chantebon,</hi> where the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Camboya</hi> begins; and oppoſite thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Peninſula extra Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi> which lies on the Weſt of the Gulph of <hi>Siam,</hi> it extends to <hi>Queda</hi> and <hi>Patana,</hi> the Territories of the <hi>Malayans,</hi> of which <hi>Malaca</hi> was formerly the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their Kings.</note>Their firſt King was named <hi>Pra Poat honne ſourittep-pennaratui ſonanne bopitra.</hi> The chief place where he kept his Court was called <hi>Tchai pappe Mahanacon,</hi> the ſituation of which I ignore; and he began to reign <hi>An.</hi> 1300. computing after their <hi>Epocha.</hi> Ten other Kings ſucceeded him, the laſt of which, named <hi>Ipoja ſanne Thora Theſma Teperat,</hi> remov'd his Royal Seat to the City of <hi>Taſco Nacora Louang,</hi> which he had built, the ſituation of which is alſo unknown to me. The twelfth King after him, whoſe Name was <hi>Pra Poa Noome Thele ſeri,</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all his People in 1731, to follow him to <hi>Locintai,</hi> a City ſeated on a River, which deſcends from the Mountains of <hi>Laos,</hi> and runs into the <hi>Menam</hi> a little above <hi>Porſelouc,</hi> from which <hi>Locontai</hi> is between 40 and 50 Leagues diſtant. But this Prince reſided not always at <hi>Locontai;</hi> for he came and built, and inhabited the City of <hi>Pipeli</hi> on a River, the mouth of which is about two Leagues to the Weſt of the moſt occidental mouth of <hi>Menam.</hi> Four other Kings ſucceeded him, of which <hi>Rhamatilondi,</hi> the laſt of the four, began to build the City of <hi>Siam</hi> in 1894, and there eſtabliſhed his Court. By which it appears, that they allow to the City of <hi>Siam</hi> the Antiquity of 338 years. The King Regent is the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth from <hi>Rhamatilondi,</hi> and this year 1689, is the 56<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 57<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age. Thus do they reckon 52 Kings in the ſpace of 934 years, but not all of the ſame Blood.</p>

King who was not of the Royal Race, tho' <hi>Vliet</hi> aſſerts the contrary, took away the Scepter and Life of his Natural Lords, and put to death all the Princes of their Blood except two, which were alive when <hi>Vliet</hi> writ, but of whom I could not learn any News. Without all doubt this Uſurper put them to death like the reſt. And in truth, <hi>John Struys,</hi> in the <hi>First Tome of his Voyages,</hi> aſſerts that this was the Fate of the laſt of theſe two Princes, who was alive in the year 1650, and was then 20 years old; the Tyrant put him to death that very year, with one of his Siſters, upon an Accuſation notoriouſly falſe: But a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumſtance of the Hiſtory of his Uſurpation, was, that entering by force of Arms into the Palace, he forced the King to quit it, and flie into a Temple for refuge; and having drag'd this unfortunate Prince out of this Temple, and carry'd him back a Priſoner to the Palace, he caus'd him to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unworthy of the Crown and Government, for having deſerted the Palace. To this Uſurper who died in 1657, after a Reign of 30 years, ſucceeded his Brother; becauſe his Son could not, or durſt not then to diſpute the Crown with him. On the contrary, to ſecure his Life, he ſought a Sanctuary in a Cloyſter, and cloath'd himſelf with the inviolable Habit of a <hi>Talapoin.</hi> But he afterwards ſo politickly took his meaſures, that he diſpoſſeſs'd his Uncle, who flying from the Palace on his Elephant, was ſlain by a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> with a Muſquet.</p>

                        </note> who reigned in 1547, and to whom he gives great Praiſes, was poyſon'd by the Queen his Wife at his return from a military Expedition. This Princeſs deliberated thus to prevent the vengeance of her Husband, by reaſon that during his abſence ſhe had maintain'd an amorous Commerce, by which ſhe prov'd with Child. And this Author adds, that ſhe ſoon after deſtroy'd the King her own Son in the ſame manner, and had the Credit to get the Crown ſet upon her Lover's Head the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1548. But in <hi>January</hi> 1549, they were both aſſaſſinated in a Temple, and a Baſtard Prince, the Brother and Uncle of the two laſt Kings, was taken out of a Cloyſter to be advanced on the Throne. The Crowns of <hi>Aſia</hi> are always inſtable, and thoſe of <hi>India, China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> much more than the others.</p>
                     <p>As for what concerns the Origine of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> it would be difficult to judge whether they are only a ſingle People,<note place="margin">A Doubt as to the Origine of the <hi>Siame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>

                     <p>The principal Reaſon of this Doubt proceeds from the <hi>Siameſes</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Languages, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vulgar, which is a ſimple Tongue,<note place="margin">Two Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> conſiſting almoſt wholly of Monoſyllables, without Conjugation or Declenſion; and another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which I have already ſpoken of, which to them is a dead Tongue, known only by the Learned, which is called the <hi>Balie</hi> Tongue, and which is enricht with the inflexions of words, like the Languages we have in <hi>Europe.</hi> The terms of Religion and Juſtice, the names of Offices, and all the Ornaments of the Vulgar Tongue are borrow'd from the <hi>Balie.</hi> In this Language they compoſe their beſt Songs; ſo that it ſeems at leaſt that ſome Foreign Colony had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inhabited the Countrey of <hi>Siam,</hi> and had carry'd thither a ſecond Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.

                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> aſſert that their Laws are Foreign,<note place="margin">What the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> report concerning the Origine of their Laws and Religion.</note> and came to them from the Countrey of <hi>Laos,</hi> which has, perhaps, no other Foundation than the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Laws of <hi>Laos</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Siam,</hi> even as there is a Conformity between the Religions of theſe two Nations, and with that of the <hi>Peguins.</hi> Now this does not ſtrictly prove that any of theſe three Kingdoms hath given its Laws and its Religion to the reſt, ſeeing that it may happen that all the three may have deriv'd their Religion and their Laws from another common Source. However it be, as the Tradition is at <hi>Siam,</hi> that their Laws and Kings came from <hi>Laos,</hi> the ſame Tradition runs at <hi>Laos,</hi> that their Kings and moſt of their Laws came from <hi>Siam.</hi>

The ſecular Miſſionaries eſtabliſhed at <hi>Siam,</hi> are of opinion that this Language is not entirely extinct: by reaſon they ſaw in their Hoſpital a man come from about the Cape of <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> who interſpers'd ſeveral <hi>Balie</hi> words in his diſcourſe, affirming that they were uſed in his Country, and that he had never ſtudied, and knew only his Mother Tongue. They moreover averr for truth, that the Religion of the <hi>Siu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> came from thoſe Quarters, becauſe that they have read in a <hi>Balie</hi> Book, that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> whom the <hi>Siameſes</hi> adore, was the Son of a King of the Iſland of <hi>Ceylon.</hi>

At preſent they uſe it little; and that only in ſome of their diſhes, when it is tender; and to preſerve it, they Pickle it up in Vinegar, as we do <hi>Cucumbers</hi> and <hi>Samphire.</hi> This Tree reſembles the Poplar, it is ſtrait and tall, and the Leaves thereof few, pale, and longiſh. It is hollow, and grows in ſhoots like our Reeds, and its ſhoots are ſeparated from one another by knots: but it has Branches and Thorns, which our Reeds have not. It grows very cloſe, and the ſame Roots do ſhoot forth ſeveral ſtems, ſo that nothing is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or more difficult to paſs than a Foreſt of <hi>Bambou;</hi> and ſo much the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wood thereof is hard and difficult to cut, although it be eaſie to cleave. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſet it on fire by Friction, which is a token of its hardneſs. They have two pieces of <hi>Bambou</hi> cleſt, which are like two pieces of Lath, in the edge of the one they do make a notch, and do forcibly rub in this hole with the edge of the other, as with a Saw; and ſome dry leaves, or other combuſtible matter, which is put in the notch, fails not to catch fire without firing the <hi>Bambou.</hi> There is no Reed but has naturally ſomewhat either more or leſs of a Sugary juice. That of the <hi>Bambou</hi> is famous in ſome places of <hi>India,</hi> as an excellent Remedy for ſeveral Maladies. It eſcaped my curioſity to ask whether the Sugar of the <hi>Bambou</hi> of <hi>Siam</hi> is as much ſought after upon this account, as that of the <hi>Bambou</hi> of <hi>Malaca,</hi> which is not far diſtant.</p>

                           <hi>The</hi> Arvore de Raiz.</note>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> report that they likewiſe have that Tree, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have called <hi>Arvore de Raiz,</hi> and they <hi>Co-pai,</hi> but that they have no plenty: and they add that its wood hath this property (doubtleſs by its ſmell) that when any perſon hath a little of it near him in his Bed, it drives away the Gnats. 'Tis from the Branches of this Tree, ſo frequently deſcribed in the Relations of <hi>India,</hi> that ſeveral Fibers do hang down to the ground, which there take root, and become as ſo many new Trunks: ſo that by little and little this Tree gains a conſiderable plot of ground, on which it forms a kind of Labyrinth by its ſtems, which continually multiply, and which adhere to one another by the branches, from which theſe ſtems are fall'n. We have ſeen the <hi>Siameſes</hi> ſeek out other Remedies againſt the Gnats than that of this wood: and this perſwades me either that it is very rare, or that this vertue which is attributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is not well atteſted.</p>

                        </note>But the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have other Trees more uſeful, and in great plenty. From the one they do gather Cotton: another yields them <hi>Capoc,</hi> a kind of Cotton-wool extreamly fine, and ſo ſhort that 'tis impoſſible to ſpin it, to them it ſerves inſtead of Down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Trees which produce Oyls or Gums.</note>From certain Trees they extract ſeveral Oyls which they mix in Ciments, to render them more binding. A wall that is plaiſter'd therewith, is whiter, and bears as good a Poliſh as Marble; and a Baſon made of one of theſe Ciments preſerves water better then glazed Earth. They do likewiſe make better Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar than our's: by reaſon that in the water which they uſe, they do boyl a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bark, the skins of Oxen, or Buffalo's, and Sugar. A kind of Trees very common in their Woods yeilds that Gum, which compoſes the body of that excellent Varniſh, which we ſee on ſeveral works of <hi>Japan,</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> do call this Gum <hi>Cheyram,</hi> a word perhaps derived from <hi>Cheyra,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Perfume,</hi> although this Gum has not any Odor of it ſelf. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do not well know how to put it in uſe. At <hi>Siam</hi> I ſaw a <hi>Tunquineſe</hi> of this Trade, but he wrought nothing well for want perhaps of a certain Oil which was neceſſary to mix with the <hi>Cheyram,</hi> and which he ſupplied, as he could, by a much worſe. I would have brought him to <hi>France,</hi> had he not been afraid to paſs the Sea, as he had promiſed me at firſt. In a word, ſome ſay that the beſt way to render the Varniſh more curious, is to lay on the more coverings, but this is to make it much dearer. The Relations of <hi>China</hi> do alſo declare, that there are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Materials for the Varniſh, and that the one is much better than the other. The <hi>Cheyram</hi> is proved by a drop thereof pour'd into Water; and if this drop ſinks to the bottom without ſeparating, the <hi>Cheyram</hi> is good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Trees whoſe Bark ſerves to make Paper.</note>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> make Paper of old Cotton rags, and likewiſe of the bark of a Tree named <hi>Ton coi,</hi> which they pound as they do the old rags: but theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have a great deal leſs Equality, Body and Whiteneſs than ours. The <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> ceaſe not to write thereon with <hi>China</hi> Ink. Yet moſt frequently they black them, which renders them ſmoother, and gives them a greater body; and then they write thereon with a kind of <hi>Crayon,</hi> which is made only of a clayiſh Earth dry'd in the Sun. Their Books are not bound, and conſiſt only in a very long Leaf, which they roll not up as our Anceſtors did theirs, but which they fold in and out like a Fan: and the way which the Lines are wrote, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of the folds, and not according to their breadth. Beſides this they write with a Styletto and the Leaves of a Tree reſembling the Palm: This Tree they call <hi>Tan,</hi> and theſe Leaves <hi>Bailan;</hi> they cut them in a very long and narrow Square, and on theſe Tables are writ the Tables and Prayers, which the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do ſing in their Temples.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have alſo Timber proper for the building of Ships, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Maſts: But they having no Hemp, their Cordages are made of the <hi>Brou</hi>

                           <hi>Brou</hi> is a green Bark or skin which is on the <hi>Coco,</hi> like as on our Nuts: but that of the <hi>Coco</hi> is three fingers thick, and its Fibers may be twiſted into a Cord.</note> of <hi>Coco,</hi> and their Sails are Mats of great Ruſhes: Theſe Equipments do not countervail ours by much; but their Sails have this advantage, that ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly ſupporting themſelves, they do better receive the Wind, when it is near it; that is to ſay when it blows as much againſt us as poſſibly it can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contrary to the Courſe.</p>

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98501:13"/>In fine, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have Timber proper for building of Houſes,<note place="margin">Wood for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes.</note> for Wainſcotting and Carving; they have both light and very heavy Wood, ſome eaſie to cleave, and others which cleaveth not, what Wedges ſoever it receives. This laſt is called by the <hi>Europeans, Wood-Mary,</hi> and is better than any to make the Ribs of Ships. That which is heavy and tough is called <hi>Iron-wood,</hi> very well known in our Iſlands of <hi>America,</hi> and it is affirmed in proceſs of time it eats the Iron. They have a Wood which for its Lightneſs and Colour ſome conceive to be Fur, but it takes the Carver's Chiſel in ſo many different ways without ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that I queſtion whether we have any like it in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But above all, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have Trees ſo high and ſo ſtrait,<note place="margin">Trees for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</hi>
                        </note> that one alone is ſufficient to make a Boat or <hi>Balon,</hi> as the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſpeak, between 16 and 20 Fathom long. They hollow the Tree, and then by the heat of the Fire enlarge the Capacity thereof; which done, they raiſe the ſides with an edge, that is to ſay with a Board of the ſame length: And in fine, at both the ends they faſten a Prow and a Poop very high, and a little bending out, frequently adorn'd with ſculpture and gilding, and with ſome pieces of Mother of Pearl.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs amongſt ſo many different ſorts of Wood,<note place="margin">They have none of our Wood.</note> they have none of thoſe which we know in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have not been able to raiſe any Mulberry Trees, and for this reaſon they have no Silk-worms. No Flax alſo grows amongſt them, nor in any other place of <hi>India,</hi> or at leaſt it is not in any eſteem. The Cotton which they have in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance is, they ſay, more agreeable and more healthful to them; by reaſon that Cotton-cloth grows not cold by being wet with ſweat, and conſequently occaſions not the catching cold, as Linnen does.</p>
                     <p>They have the Cinnamon Tree,<note place="margin">The Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Fir Tree.</note> inferior indeed to that of the Iſland of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but better than any other; they have the <hi>Sapan,</hi> and other Woods proper for Dying.</p>

                        </note> not ſo good indeed as the <hi>Calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> but better than the Wood <hi>Aquila</hi> of any other Country. This Wood is found only in pieces, by reaſon they are only certain rotten places in Trees of a certain kind. And every Tree of this ſame Species has it not, and thoſe which have, have them not all in the ſame place; ſo that it requires a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſearch in the Wood. 'Twas formerly very dear at <hi>Paris,</hi> but is at preſent to be had at a reaſonable rate.</p>

                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">Tambac.</note>But the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> to render his mixture more precious, caus'd ſome Gold to be added thereunto: and this is what they call <hi>Tambac.</hi> 'Tis ſaid that the Mines of the Iſle of <hi>Borneo</hi> do naturally produce it very Rich: and the ſcarceneſs augments the price thereof, as it formerly increaſed that of the famous <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Braſs; but certainly that which makes the true value thereof amongſt the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes,</hi> is the quantity of Gold wherewith it is thought to be mixed. When their Avarice creates deſires it is for the Gold, and not for the <hi>Tambac;</hi> and we have ſeen that when the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has ordered Crucifixes to be made to preſent to the Chriſtians, the moſt noble and ſmalleſt part, which is the <hi>Christ,</hi> has been of Gold, the Croſs alone of <hi>Tambac. Vincent le Blanc</hi> relates, that the <hi>Peguins</hi> have a mixture of Lead and Copper, which he calls ſometimes <hi>Ganze,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Ganza,</hi> and of which he reports that they make Statues, and a ſmall Money which is not ſtampt with the Kings Coin, but which every one has a right to make.</p>

                        </note>He informed me that he rectified the labours of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> in ſome things, ſo that they obtain a little more profit than they did. He ſhow'd them a Mine of very good Steel at the top of a Mountain, which had been already diſcovered, and which they perceived not. He diſcovered to them one of Cryſtal, one of Antimony, one of Emeril, and ſome others, with a Quarry of white Marble. Beſides this, he found out a Gold Mine, which to him appear'd very rich, as far as he was able to judge without trying it; but he has not ſhowed it them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Siameſes,</hi> moſt <hi>Talapoins,</hi> came ſecretly to conſult him about the Art of purifying and ſeparating Metals, and brought him divers ſpecimens of very rich Ore. From ſome he extracted a very good quantity of fine Silver, and from others, the mixture of ſeveral Metals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Tin and Lead.</note>As for Tin and Lead, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have long ſince improved it from very plentiful Mines, and though not very skilful, yet they ceaſe not to get a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable revenue by it. This Tin, or Calin, as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> report, is ſold through all <hi>India;</hi> 'Tis ſoft and baſely purified, and a ſpecimen thereof is ſeen in the common Tea Boxes or Canniſters, which come from this Country. But to render it harder and whiter, like that of the fineſt Tea Boxes, they mix it with Cadmia, a ſort of Mineral eaſily reducible to powder, which being melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Copper, makes it yellow: but it renders both theſe Metals more brittle: And 'tis this white Tin which they call <hi>Tontinague.</hi> This is what Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> relates on the ſubject of the Mines of <hi>Siam.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98501:14"/>
thereof is three or four Fingers broad, and about a Foot long. The King gives the Sabre and the Poniard. They wear the Poniard on the left ſide, hanging a little before. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> do call it <hi>Christ,</hi> a word corrupted from <hi>Crid,</hi> which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> uſe.

As for the Sabre, a Slave always carries it before his Maſter on his right ſhoulder, as we carry the Muſquet on the left.</p>
                     <p>They have Iron Mines which they know how to melt,<note place="margin">Iron.</note> and ſome have inform'd me that they have but little thereof; beſides, they are bad Forge-men.

They have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pins, nor Needles, nor Nails, nor Chiſels, nor Saws. They uſe not a Nail in building their Houſes, altho' they be all of Wood. Every one makes Pins of Bambou, even as our Anceſtors us'd Thorns for this purpoſe. To them there comes Padlocks from <hi>Japan,</hi> ſome of Iron, which are good; and others of Copper, which are very naught.</p>
                     <p>They do make very bad Gunpowder.

                     <p>Having deſcribed the natural Riches of the Mountains and Foreſts of <hi>Siam,</hi> 'twould be proper in this place to ſpeak of the Elephants, Rhinoceros, Tygers, and all other ſavage Beaſts wherewith they are ſtored: yet ſeeing this matter has been ſufficiently explicated by a great many others, I ſhall omit it, to paſs on to the inhabited and cultivated Lands.</p>

Before the mouth of the <hi>Menam,</hi> there is a Bank of Owſe, which, in the Sea-phraſe, is call'd the Bar, and which prohibits entrance to great Ships. 'Tis probable that it will increaſe itſelf by little and little, and will in time make a new Shore to the firm Land.</p>

                        </note> that is the real cauſe of the Fertility of <hi>Siam,</hi> where-ever the Inundation extends itſelf. In other, and eſpecially on the higheſt places, all is dry'd and burnt with the Sun, in a little time after the Rains. Under the Torrid Zone, and likewiſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Climate is more temperate, if the Lands are naturally fertile, (as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, between <hi>Murcia</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where the Seed yields ſometimes an hundred fold) they are nevertheleſs ſo ſubject to Drought, Inſects, and other Inconveniences, that it frequently happens that they are deprived of the whole Harveſt ſeveral years together: And 'tis this which betides all the Countries of <hi>India</hi> which are not ſubject to be overflowed, and which beſides the barrenneſs of the Soil, do ſuffer the ravages of contagious and peſtilential Diſtempers which ſucceed it. But the annual Inundation gives to <hi>Siam</hi> the aſſurance and plenty of the Rice Harveſt, and renders this Kingdom the Nouriſher of ſeveral others.</p>

After this precaution, the Ants have no more power to bite, and the Books are more agreeable, by reaſon that this Gum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixt with nothing that colours it, has the ſame luſtre as the Glaſſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we cover Pictures in Miniature.

Sometimes alſo thoſe little Cups varniſh'd with red, which come to us from <hi>Japan,</hi> and whoſe lightneſs aſtoniſhes us, do conſiſt only of a double Cloth put into the form of a Cup, and cover'd over with this Gum mixt with a colour, which we call <hi>Lacca,</hi> or <hi>Chineſe</hi> Varniſh, as I have already declar'd: theſe Cups laſt not long, when too hot Liquors are put therein.</p>

What it has moſt ſingular (beſides the ſcales in form of rings, which cover its body, and which inſert themſelves one into the other in its motions) is, that it pinches equally with its head and tail, but its Stings, tho' painful, are not mortal. A <hi>French</hi> Man of that Crew which went to <hi>Siam</hi> with us, and whom we left there in perfect health, ſuffer'd himſelf to be ſtung in his Bed above a quarter of an hour, without daring to lay hold on the Worm to relieve himſelf.

They have ſome light in their Eyes, but their greateſt ſplendor proceeds from under their wings, and glitters only in the Air, when the wings are diſplay'd. What ſome report therefore is not true, that they might be us'd in the Night inſtead of Candles; for tho' they had light enough, what method could be contriv'd to make them always flie, and keep them at a due diſtance to illuminate?

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>RICE</hi> is the principal Harveſt of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and their beſt Nouriſhment;<note place="margin">Rice.</note>
it refreſhes and fattens: And we found our Ship's Crew expreſs ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, when after a three months allowance thereof, they were return'd to Bisket; and yet the Bisket was very good, and well kept.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> know by experience how to meaſure the water,<note place="margin">The way of boiling it in pure water;</note> fire and time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the <hi>Rice,</hi> without burſting the Grain, and ſo it ſerves them for Bread. Not that they mix it with all their other Food as we do Bread; when they eat Fleſh or Fiſh for example, they eat the one and the other without <hi>Rice;</hi> and when they eat <hi>Rice,</hi> they eat it ſeparately. They ſqueeze it a little between the ends of their Fingers to reduce it into a Paſte, and ſo they put it into their mouth, as our Poor do eat Pottage. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> do never touch any meat but with two ſmall Sticks ſquar'd at the end, which do ſerve them inſtead of a Fork. They hold to their lower Lip a ſmall Porcelane or <hi>China</hi> Cup, wherein is their portion of <hi>Rice;</hi> and holding it ſteady with their left hand, they ſtrike the <hi>Rice</hi> into their mouth with the two Sticks which they hold in their right hand.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Levantines,</hi> or Eaſtern People,<note place="margin">Or in milk.</note> do ſometimes boil <hi>Rice</hi> with Fleſh and Pepper, and then put ſome Saffron thereunto, and this Diſh they call <hi>Pilau.</hi> This is not the practice of the <hi>Siameſes:</hi> but generally they boil the <hi>Rice</hi> in clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I have ſaid; and ſometimes they boil it with milk, as we do on faſting days.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Siam,</hi> in the Lands high enough to avoid the Inundation,<note place="margin">Wheat.</note> there grows Wheat: they water them either with watering Pots like thoſe in our Gardens, or by overflowing it with the Rain-water, which they keep in Ciſterns much higher than theſe Lands. But either by reaſon of the Care or Expence, or that the <hi>Rice</hi> ſuffices for common uſe, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> only has Wheat; and perhaps more out of Curioſity, than a real Guſto. They call it <hi>Kaou Poſſali,</hi> and the word <hi>Kaou</hi> ſimply ſignifieth <hi>Rice.</hi> Now theſe terms being neither <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi> nor <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> nor <hi>Perſian,</hi> I doubt of what was told me, that Wheat was brought to <hi>Siam</hi> by the <hi>Moors.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> which are ſetled there, do import Meal from <hi>Surrat;</hi> altho' near <hi>Siam</hi> there is a Windmil to grind Corn, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther near <hi>Louvo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word, the Bread which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> gave us, was ſo dry,<note place="margin">Wheaten Bread too dry at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> that the <hi>Rice</hi> boil'd in pure water, how inſipid ſoever, was more agreeable to me. I leſs wonder therefore at what the Relations of <hi>China</hi> report, that the Soveraign of this great Kingdom, altho' he has Bread, does rather prefer <hi>Rice:</hi> yet ſome <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> aſſur'd me, that the wheaten Bread of <hi>Siam</hi> is good, and that the drineſs of ours muſt proceed from a little Rice-flower, which is doubtleſs mixt with the Wheat, for fear perhaps leſt the Bread ſhould fail.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Siam</hi> I have ſeen Peaſe different from ours. The <hi>Siameſes,</hi> like us,<note place="margin">Other Grain.</note> do make more than one Crop, but they make only one in a year upon the ſame Land: not that the Soil was not good enough, in my opinion, to yield two Crops in a year, as ſome have related concerning ſome other Cantons of <hi>India,</hi> if the Inundation did not laſt ſo long. They have Turky-Wheat only in their Gardens. They do boil or parch the whole Ear thereof, without unhusking or breaking off the Grains, and they eat the inſide.</p>

They guide them with a Rope put through a hole which they make in the Cartilage that ſeparates the Noſtrils: And to the end that the Rope may not ſlip when they draw it, they do tie a knot on each ſide. This ſame Cord runs alſo through a hole, which is at the end of the draught Tree of their Plough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſe</hi> Plough.</note>The Plough of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> is plain, and without Wheels. It conſiſts in a long Beam which is the Rudder, in another crooked piece which is the Handle, and in another ſhorter and ſtronger piece, faſtned almoſt at Right Angles under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath at the end of the Handle; and 'tis this Third which bears the ſhare. They faſten not theſe four pieces with Nails, but with leather Thongs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How they cleanſe the Rice from the Chaff.</note>To unhusk the <hi>Rice,</hi> they employ large Beaſts; when it is trodden out; they let it fall by little and little from a very high place, to the end that the wind may carry away the Chaff. And becauſe the <hi>Rice</hi> has an hard Skin like Spelt, a ſort of Corn very common in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other places, they bruiſe it in a great wooden Mortar, with a Peſtle of the ſame; or in a Hand-mill, all the pieces of which are alſo of Wood. They knew not how to deſcribe them to me.</p>

I mean, that when it is Monday here, it is Monday there, and ſo of the reſt; but the day begins about ſix hours ſooner there, than here. Amongſt the Names they have given to the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, that of <hi>Mercury</hi> is <hi>Pout,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> word, which ſignifies an <hi>Idol;</hi> from whence comes <hi>Pout-Gheda,</hi> a Temple of falſe Gods; and <hi>Pagode</hi> comes from <hi>Pout-Gheda.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">From whence they begin their years.</note>They begin their year on the firſt day of the Moon in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> according to certain Rules; and they do not always denote the years by their number, but by the names they give them; for they make uſe of a Cycle of ſixty years, like the other Eaſtern Nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cycle of 60 years.</note>A Sexagenary Cycle is a Revolution of ſixty years, as a week is a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeven days; and they have names for the years of the Cycle, as we have for the days of the week. 'Tis true, I have not been able to diſcover that they have more than twelve different names, which they repeat five times in every Cycle to arrive at the number of ſixty, and in my opinion with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which do make the differences thereof. They will date therefore, for inſtance, from the year of the <hi>Pigg,</hi> or of the <hi>Great Serpent,</hi> which amongſt them are the names of the year; and they will not always denote what year of their <hi>Aera</hi> this ſhall be, as we ſometimes date a Letter upon one of the days of the week to which we ſet down the name, without noting what number it is in the month. At the end of this Relation, I will give you the twelve names of the years in <hi>Siameſe,</hi> with thoſe of the ſeven days of the week.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Their months.</note>Their months are vulgarly eſteem'd to conſiſt of thirty days. I ſay vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe that in Aſtronomical exactneſs there may be ſome month longer or ſhorter; but the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do obſerve it otherwiſe than we, in that we give names to the months, and they do not.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98501:16"/>
Winter at the ſame time as we; by reaſon they lye to the North line like us. But their greateſt Winter is at leaſt as hot as our greateſt Summer. After the time of the Inundation they cover the Plants in their Gardens from the heats of the Sun, as we do ſometimes cover ours from the cold of the Night or Winter: But as to their Perſons, the diminution of the heat appears unto them a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious cold. The little Summer is their Spring, and they utterly ignore the Autumn. They only reckon a great Summer; although it ſeems that they might reckon two after the manner of the Ancients, who have written of <hi>India,</hi> ſeeing that they have the Sun perpendicularly over their heads twice a year; once when it comes from the Line to the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and another time when it returns from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> towards the Line.</p>
                     <p>Their Winter is dry, and their Summer rainy.<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons.</hi>
                        </note> The Torrid Zone would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be uninhabitable, as the Ancients have held, were it not for that marvellous Providence which makes the Sun continually to draw the Clouds and Rains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and the Wind inceſſantly to blow there from one of the Poles, when the Sun is toward the other. Thus at <hi>Siam</hi> in Winter, the Sun being in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Line, or towards the Antarctick Pole, the North-winds do conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail, and temper the Air very ſenſibly to refreſh it. In Summer, when the Sun is on the North of the Line, and perpendicularly over the head of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameſes,</hi> the South-winds which continually blow there, do cauſe continual Rains, or at leaſt do make the weather always inclined to Rain; leaving moſt People in doubt whether this Seaſon of Rains ought not to be called the Winter of <hi>Siam.</hi> 'Tis this conſtant Rule of the Winds, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have called <hi>Monçaos,</hi> and we after them <hi>Monſoons (Motiones aëris,</hi> according to <hi>Ozorius</hi> and <hi>Maffeus.</hi>) And this is the reaſon that the Ships can hardly arrive at the Bar of <hi>Siam</hi> during the ſix Months of the North-winds, and that they can hardly depart thence during the ſix Months of the South-winds. At the end of this work I will give the order of the Winds and Tides in the Gulph of <hi>Siam,</hi> in favour of thoſe that love to reaſon on Philoſophical matters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do not give many forms to their Lands.<note place="margin">The time of ploughing and reaping.</note> They till them and ſowe them, when the Rains have ſufficiently ſoftened them; and they gather their harveſt when the waters are retired, and ſometimes when they are yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground, and they can go only by Boat. All the land that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed is good for Rice, and 'tis ſaid that the Ear always ſurmounts the waters; and that if they encreaſe a foot in twenty four hours, the Rice grows a foot alſo in twenty four hours: but though it be averr'd that this happens ſometimes, I cannot without much difficulty believe it in ſo vaſt an Inundation: And I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive that when the Inundation ſurmounts the Rice at any time, it rots it.</p>
                     <p>They gather Rice alſo in divers Cantons of the Kingdom which the Rains do not overflow; and this is more ſubſtantial, better reliſht, and keeps longer.<note place="margin">Another ſort of Rice.</note>
When it has grown long enough in the Land where it was ſown, it is tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into another, which is prepared after this manner. They overflow it, as we do the Salt Marſhes, until it be throughly ſoft; and for this purpoſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have high Ciſterns, or rather to keep the Rain-water in the Field it ſelf by little Banks made all round. Then they let the water go to feed the Land, level it, and in fine, tranſplant the Rice-Roots one after the other, by thruſting them in with the Thumb.</p>
                     <p>I am greatly inclin'd to believe,<note place="margin">The original of Agriculture with the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes.</hi>
                        </note> that the Ancient <hi>Siameſes</hi> lived only upon Fruits and Fiſh, as ſtill do ſeveral people of the Coaſts of <hi>Africk;</hi> and that in proceſs of time Husbandry has been taught them by the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> We read in the Hiſtory of <hi>China</hi> that 'twas anciently the King himſelf, that annually firſt ſet his hand to the Plough in this great Kingdom, and that of the Crop which his Labour yielded him, he made the Bread for the Sacrifices. The Lawful King of <hi>Tonquin</hi> and <hi>Cochinchina</hi> together, who is called the <hi>Buado</hi>'s, likewiſe obſerve this Cuſtom of firſt breaking up the Lands every year; and of all the Royal Functions, this is almoſt the only one remaining to him. The moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant are exerciſed by two Hereditary Governors, the one of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> and the other of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> who wage war, and who are the true Soveraigns; although

This Maſquerade for one day gets him wherewithal to live on the whole year. And by the ſame ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition has deterred the Kings themſelves.

theſe Flowers have leſs ſcent here than in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Roſes</hi> have hardly any.

I have remark'd of ſome that they ſmell only in the Night, by reaſon that the heat of the day diſſipates all their Spirits.

whereas to our Palate Water which has no ſmell, is the beſt. As the <hi>Siameſes</hi> go not to draw it at the Springs, which are doubtleſs too remote, it is wholeſom only when it has been ſetled more or fewer days, according as the Inundation is higher or lower, or wholly run out: For when the Waters retire, and they are filled with Mud, and perhaps with the ill Juices which they take from the Earth, or when the River is re-entred into its Channel ſufficiently muddy, they are more corroſive, do cauſe Diſenteries and Lasks, and cannot be drunk without danger, till they have let them ſtand in great Jars or Pitchers, the ſpace of three Weeks or a Month.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Louvo</hi> the Waters are much more unwholſome than at <hi>Siam;</hi>

The King of <hi>Siam</hi> drinks water from a great Ciſtern made in the Fields, on which is kept a continual Watch. Beſides that this Prince has a little houſe called <hi>Tlee Pouſſone,</hi> or <hi>Rich Sea,</hi> about a League from <hi>Louvo.</hi> It is ſeated on the brink of certain Low-lands, about two or three Leagues in extent, which receive the Rain-waters and preſerve them. This little Sea is of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure, its Shores are neither handſom nor even; but its Waters are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, by reaſon they are deep and ſetled, and I have alſo heard that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> drinks thereof.</p>
                     <p>For pleaſure and converſation the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do take <hi>Tea,</hi>

But at <hi>Siam</hi> the Cuſtom is throughly ſetled, and 'tis amongſt them a neceſſary Civility to preſent <hi>Tea</hi> to all that viſit them. They call it <hi>Tcha,</hi> as do the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and have not two Terms, the one for what we call <hi>Tea,</hi> and the other for what we call <hi>Cha,</hi> or Flower of <hi>Tea.</hi> 'Tis certain that it is not a Flower But to aſſert whether they are the budding Leaves, and conſequently the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt, or the higheſt, and conſequently the leſs nouriſhed, or the point of the Leaves, which have been boil'd at <hi>China,</hi> or a kind of particular <hi>Tea;</hi> is what I cannot determine, by reaſon that various Accounts have been given me thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do reckon three ſorts of Tea, the <hi>Tchaboui</hi> or <hi>Boui Tea,</hi>

But then they make it ſtronger, and after having drunk five or ſix Cups, they lye down in their bed, cover themſelves up, and ſweat. It is not very difficult, in ſuch hot Climates, for Sudorificks to operate, and they are looked upon there almoſt as general Remedies.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The manner of preparing Tea.</note>They prepare the <hi>Tea</hi> in this manner. They have Copper Pots tinn'd on the inſide, wherein they boil the Water; and it boils in an inſtant, by reaſon the Copper thereof is very thin. This Copper comes from <hi>Japan,</hi> if my Memory fails me not; and 'tis ſo eaſie to work, that I queſtion whether we have any ſo pliant in <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe Pots are called <hi>Boulis;</hi> and on the other hand they have <hi>Boulis</hi> of red Earth, which is without taſte, tho without Varniſh. They firſt rince the Earthen <hi>Bouli</hi> with boiling water to heat it, then they put in as much <hi>Tea,</hi> as one can take up with the Finger and Thumb, and afterwards fill it with boiling water; and after having covered it, they ſtill pour boiling water on the outſide, they ſtop not the Spout as we do. When the Tea is ſufficiently infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is to ſay when the Leaves are precipitated, they pour the Liquor into <hi>China</hi> diſhes; which at firſt they fill only half, to the end that if it appear too ſtrong or too deep, they may temper it, by pouring in pure water, which they ſtill keep boiling in the Copper <hi>Bouly.</hi> Nevertheleſs if they will ſtill drink, they do again fill the Earthen <hi>Bouly</hi> with this boiling water, and ſo they may do ſeveral times without adding any more <hi>Tea,</hi> until they ſee that the water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no tincture. They put no Sugar into the Diſhes, by reaſon they have none refin'd which is not candy, and the candy melts too ſlowly. They do therefore take a little in their mouth, which they champ as they drink their <hi>Tea.</hi> When they would have no more <hi>Tea,</hi> they turn the Cup down on the Saucer; becauſe that 'tis the greateſt incivility among them to refuſe any thing, and that if they leave the Cup ſtanding, they fail not to ſerve them again with <hi>Tea,</hi> which they are oblig'd to receive. But they forbear to fill the Diſh, unleſs they would teſtifie to him unto whom they preſent it full, that 'tis, as ſome ſay, for once, and that it is not expected that he ever come again to the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Excellent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neceſſary for Tea.</note>The moſt experienced do ſay that the Water cannot be too clear for Tea, that Ciſtern-water is the beſt as being the moſt pure, and that the fineſt <hi>Tea</hi> in the world becomes bad in water, which is not excellent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Whether it is neceſſary to drink the Tea hot.</note>In a word, if the <hi>Chineſes</hi> drink <hi>Tea</hi> ſo hot, 'tis not perhaps that they have found it either more wholeſom or more pleaſant after this manner; for they drink all ſorts of Liquor at the ſame degree of heat, unleſs the Tartars have now taught them, as it is ſaid, to drink Ice. 'Tis true that the infuſion of Tea is perform'd quicker in hot water than cold; but I have drunk with pleaſure what I had infuſed cold for above a day.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> adhere not to Tea: they freely drink Wine, when they have it; altho whatever inebriates is prohibited them by their Morality. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> do ſometimes bring it them from <hi>Schiras</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> or from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Our <hi>Bourdcaux</hi> and <hi>Chors</hi> Wines came very ſound to <hi>Siam,</hi> altho they had twice paſſed the Line; and at our return the remainder of theſe Wines, was perhaps much ſtronger and better kept, than it would have been, had it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued always a ſhore. I ſay nothing concerning the Wines of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> which are only Beers exceedingly well mixt, but very pleaſant.

The manner of collecting this drink is, in the Evening to make an Inciſion in the bark of the Tree, near the top of its Trunk, and to apply thereunto a Bottle as cloſe as it is poſſible, luteing it with Clay, that the Air may not enter therein. The next Morning the Bottle is full, and this Bottle is generally a Pipe of great <hi>Bambou,</hi> to which the knot ſerves as a bottom. Theſe two Liquors may alſo be collected in the day time, but it is ſaid that then they are eager, and are uſed as Vinegar. The <hi>Tari</hi> is drawn from a ſort of wild <hi>Cocotier,</hi> or Coco-tree, and <hi>Neri</hi> from the <hi>Arequier,</hi> a ſort of Tree which I ſhall preſently ſpeak of.</p>

but they convert it into <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> which they call <hi>Laou,</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe Arak,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> word, which properly ſignifies <hi>ſweat,</hi> and metaphorically <hi>eſſence,</hi> and by way of excellence <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> Of the Rice Beer they likewiſe make Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> inhabiting at <hi>Siam</hi> do uſe a drink which they call <hi>Punch,</hi>

The <hi>French</hi> call this drink <hi>Boule Ponche,</hi> and <hi>Bonne Ponche,</hi> from the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> words, a Bowl of Punch.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the Moors of <hi>Siam</hi> drink <hi>Coffee,</hi>

But excepting <hi>Oranges, Citrons</hi> and <hi>Pomegranates,</hi> there is not at <hi>Siam</hi> any of the fruits that we know. The Citrons which they call <hi>Ma-crout,</hi> are ſmall, full of Juice and very ſowre, and the skin very ſmooth. They appeared to me of a ſingular quality, in that they are rotten on the inſide, when their peel is ſound and entire. But they have moreover a kind of ſowre, and no ſweet Lemons, and on the contrary the Oranges and Pomegranates are all ſweet; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſowre Oranges they would take the <hi>Pampelmouſes,</hi> which have the taſte and ſhape thereof, but which are as big as Melons, and have not much Juice. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do with reaſon range them among the ſpecies of Oranges, and call them <hi>Soum-o,</hi> and <hi>Soum</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Orange.</hi> Amongſt the ſweet Oranges the beſt have the Peel very green and rough; they call them <hi>Soum-keou,</hi> or <hi>Cryſtal Oranges;</hi> not that they have any tranſparency, but becauſe they appear to them in their kind, of the repute of Cryſtal, which they highly value. They give of theſe <hi>Soum-keou</hi> to their <hi>ſick,</hi> and ſell them, as 'tis ſaid, at five <hi>ſous</hi> a piece when the ſeaſon is paſt; a conſiderable price in a Country where a man commonly lives for two <hi>Liards</hi> a day.</p>
                     <p>Now tho this ſort of Oranges laſts not the whole year,<note place="margin">Certain Fruits at every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> yet there is always one ſort or other. There is alſo of that Fruit which the <hi>Europeans</hi> call <hi>Bananas,</hi> or <hi>Indian-Figs,</hi> and the <hi>Siameſes Clouei,</hi> all the year. All the other Fruits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue only a time. 'Tis at <hi>Achem</hi> only at the North Point of the Iſle of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> that Nature produces them all at every ſeaſon. Thoſe excellent Canes of one ſingle Shoot or Joynt, between nine and ten foot long, do grow only at <hi>Achem;</hi> but Rice, which is their principal nouriſhment, frequently fails them: and they do then dearly purchaſe it with the Gold, which they find ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully amongſt them, that they contemn it. without Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>I deſignedly omit the Deſcription of ſeveral Fruits,<note place="margin">The difference of the Fruits of <hi>Siam</hi> from ours.</note> and refer it to the end of this work. I will now only ſpeak of the <hi>Areca,</hi> and ſhall ſay of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fruits in general, that they have for the moſt part ſo ſtrong a taſte and ſmell, that one loves them not, till accuſtomed thereunto; and I think that then they do no hurt. By a contrary reaſon, our Fruits are at firſt inſipid and without flavor, to him that is accuſtomed to the <hi>Indian</hi> Fruits.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Areca,</hi> which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call <hi>Plou,</hi> is a kind of great Acorn,<note place="margin">The <hi>Areca</hi> and <hi>Betel,</hi>
                        </note> which yet wants that wooden Cup wherein our Acorn grows: When this Fruit is yet tender, it has at the center or heart a greyiſh ſubſtance, which is as ſoft as Pap. As it drys it waxes yellower and harder, and the ſoft ſubſtance it has at the heart grows hard too: It is always very bitter and ſavory. After having cut it into four parts with a Knife, they take a piece every time, and chew it with a Leaf reſembling Ivy called <hi>Betel</hi> by the <hi>Europeans</hi> which are at the <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>Mak</hi> by the <hi>Siameſes.</hi> They wrap it up to put it the more eaſily into the mouth, and do put on each a ſmall quantity of Lime made of Cockle-ſhells, and redded by I know not what art. For this reaſon the <hi>Indians</hi> do always carry this ſort of Lime in a very little <hi>China</hi> diſh, for they put ſo little on every Leaf, that they conſume not much In a day, altho they inceſſantly make uſe of the <hi>Areca,</hi> and the <hi>Betel.</hi> The <hi>Areca</hi> whilſt tender wholly conſumes in the Mouth, but the dry always leaves ſome remains.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their effect.</note>The ſenſible effect of this Acorn and this Leaf is to excite much ſpitting, if they care not to ſwallow the Juice; but it is good to ſpit out the two or three firſt Mouthfuls at leaſt, to avoid ſwallowing the Lime. The other leſs ſenſible effects, but which are not doubted in the <hi>Indies,</hi> are to carry from the Gums, perhaps by reaſon of the Lime, whatever may prejudice them, and to fortifie the Stomach, either by reaſon of the Juice that is ſwallowed at pleaſure, and which may have this quality, or by reaſon of the ſuperfluous moiſtures which they diſcharge by ſpitting. Thus have I never found any perſon at <hi>Siam</hi> with a ſtinking breath, which may be an effect of their natural Sobriety.</p>

                        </note>Now as the <hi>Areca</hi> and <hi>Betel</hi> do cauſe a red ſpittle independently on the red Lime which is mix'd therewith, ſo they leave a Vermilion Tincture on the Lips and Teeth. It paſſes over the Lips, but by little and little it thickens on the Teeth till they become black: So that perſons that delight in neatneſs, do blacken their Teeth, by reaſon that otherwiſe the ſpittle of the <hi>Areca</hi> and <hi>Betel,</hi> mix'd with the natural whiteneſs of the Teeth, cauſes an unpleaſant effect, which is remarked in the common People. I ſhall tranſiently declare, that the Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Lips, which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> ſaw in the Pictures of our Ladies which we had carried to this Country, made them to ſay that we muſt needs have in <hi>France,</hi> better <hi>Betel</hi> than theirs.</p>

They report that this ſoftens the Teeth a little. They afterwards rub them with a Juice, which proceeds either from a certain Root, or from the <hi>Coco,</hi> when they are burnt, and ſo the operation is perform'd. Yet it pleaſes them ſometimes to relate that it continues three days, during which it is neceſſary, they ſay, to lye on their Belly and eat no ſolid Food: But ſome have aſſur'd me that this is not true, and that it is ſufficient to eat nothing hot for two or three days. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve rather that their Teeth are too much ſet on edge, to be able for ſome time to eat any thing ſolid. It is neceſſary continually to renew this operation to make the effect thereof continue; for this Blackneſs ſticks not ſo ſtrong to the Teeth, but that it may be rub'd off with a burnt Cruſt of Bread reduc'd to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. They love alſo to redden the Nails of their little Fingers, and for this end they ſcrape them, and then apply a certain Juice, which they extract from a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rice bruiſed in Citron Juice with ſome Leaves of a ree, which in every thing reſembles the Pomegranate Tree, but bears no Fruit.</p>

Theſe ſorts of Trees do annually produce a new Shoot of Leaves, which ſpring out of the middle of the Leaves of the preceeding year, which then fall off, and leave a mark round the Trunk; ſo that by theſe marks which are ſo many knots, and which are cloſe together, they can eaſily compute the Years, or Age of the Tree.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THey hardly cloath themſelves.<note place="margin">They wear few Cloaths, not ſo much by reaſon of the heat, as by the ſimplicity of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports concerning the <hi>German</hi> Infantry in his time, that it was either all naked, or cover'd with light Coats; and even at this preſent there are ſome Savages in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>America,</hi> which go almoſt naked; which proves, in my opinion, that the ſimplicity of Manners, as well as the Heat, is the cauſe of the Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> as it is of the Nudity of theſe Savages. 'Tis not but that Cloaths are almoſt inſupportable to the <hi>French</hi> which arrive at <hi>Siam,</hi> and who know not how to forbear acting and ſtirring; but it is unhealthful for them to uncloath themſelves, by reaſon that the Injuries of the exceſſively hot Air are not leſs dreadful, than thoſe of the extreamly cold Air to which one is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd; yet with this difference, that in very hot Climats 'tis ſufficient for health, to cover the Stomach. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> do for this reaſon cover it with a Buffalo's Skin four double; but the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> whoſe Manners are plain in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, have choſen to habituate themſelves from their Infancy, to an almoſt entire Nudity.</p>
                     <p>They go with their Feet naked, and their Head bare;<note place="margin">The <hi>Pagne,</hi> the Habit of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                        </note> and for Decency only they begirt their Reins and Thighs down to their Knees with a piece of painted Cloth about two Ells and an half long, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> do call <hi>Pagne,</hi> from the Latin word <hi>Pannus;</hi> ſometimes inſtead of a painted Cloth, the <hi>Pagne</hi> is a ſilken Stuff, either plain, or embroider'd with a border of Gold and Silver.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mandarins,</hi> or Officers, do wear beſides the <hi>Pagne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Muſlin Shirt ſerves them for a Veſt.</note> a Muſlin Shirt which is as their Veſt. They pluck it off, and wrap it about their middle, when they approach a <hi>Mandarin</hi> much higher than them in Dignity, to expreſs unto him their readineſs to go where he ſhall pleaſe to ſend them. And yet the Officers whom we ſaw at the Audiences of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> remain'd cloath'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as with their Habit of Ceremony; and by the ſame reaſon they always had their Bonnets high, and pointed on the Head. Theſe Shirts have no Neck-band, and are open before, they taking no care to faſten them, to cover their Stomach. The Sleeves hang down almoſt to their Wriſts, being about two Foot wide, but without being plaited above or below. Moreover, the Body thereof is ſo ſtrait, that not ſlipping nor falling down over the <hi>Pagne,</hi> it ſets in ſeveral wrinckles.</p>
                     <p>In Winter they do ſometimes put over their ſhoulders a breadth of Stuff or painted Linnen, either like a Mantle or a Scarf,<note place="margin">A Scarf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cold.</note> the ends of which they wind very neatly about their Arms.</p>
                     <p>But the King of <hi>Siam</hi> wears a Veſt of ſome excellent Sattin brocaded,<note place="margin">How the King wears Veſts of Silk.</note> the Sleeves of which are very ſtrait, and reach down to the Wriſt; and as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel our ſelves againſt the Cold under our Waſtcoats, he puts this Veſt under the Shirt which I have deſcribed, and which he adorns with Lace, or <hi>European</hi>

Point. 'Tis not lawful for any <hi>Siameſe</hi> to wear this ſort of Veſt, unleſs the King gives it him, and he makes this Preſent only to the moſt conſiderable of his Officers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A ſort of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Veſt.</note>He ſometimes alſo gives them another Veſt or Garment of Scarlet, which is to be worn only in War, or at Hunting. This Garment reaches to the Knees, and has eight or ten Buttons before. The Sleeves thereof are wide, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ornament, and ſo ſhort, that they touch not the Elbows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for War and Hunting.</note>'Tis a general Cuſtom at <hi>Siam,</hi> that the Prince, and all his Retinue, in the War or Hunting, be cloath'd in Red. Upon this account the Shirts which are given to the Soldiers, are of Muſlin dy'd Red; and on the days of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as was that of the Entry of the King's Ambaſſadors, theſe Red Shirts were given to the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> which they put under their Arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The high, and pointed Cap.</note>The white, high, and pointed Cap, which we ſaw on the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam,</hi> is a Coif of Ceremony, whereof the King of <hi>Siam</hi> and his Officers do equally make uſe; but the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Cap is adorn'd with a Circle, or a Crown of precious Stones, and thoſe of his Officers are embelliſh'd with divers Circles of Gold, Silver, or Vermilion gilt, to diſtinguiſh their Dignities; or, have not any Ornament. The Officers wear them only before the King, or in their Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or in ſome Ceremony. They faſten them with a Stay under their Chin, and never pull them off to ſalute any perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Babouches.</note>The <hi>Moors</hi> have introduc'd amongſt them the uſe of <hi>Babouches</hi> or <hi>Slippers,</hi> a kind of pointed Shoes without quarter or heel. They leave them at the Gates of their own and others Houſes, to avoid dirtying the places where they enter. But, where-ever their King, or any other perſon is, to whom they owe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, (as is for inſtance a <hi>Sancrat,</hi> or Superior of their <hi>Talapoins</hi>) they appear not with Slippers.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Neatneſs of the Palace of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note>Nothing is neater than the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Palace, as well by reaſon of the few perſons admitted therein, as of the Precautions with which they enter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Hats for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.</note>They eſteem of Hats for Travelling, and this Prince cauſes them to be made of all Colours in almoſt the ſame ſhape with his Bonnet; but very few perſons amongſt the People vouchſafe to cover their Head againſt the heat of the Sun: and they do it but with a linnen Clout, and only when on the River, where the Reflexion moſt incommodes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Habit of the Women.</note>The difference of the Womens Habit from the Mens, is, that the Women faſtning their <hi>Pagne</hi> length-wiſe round their Bodies, as likewiſe the Men do, they let it fall down broad-ways, and imitate a cloſe Coat, which reaches down half-way their Leg; whereas the Men raiſe up their <hi>Pagne</hi> between their Thighs, by pulling through one of the ends, which they leave longer than the other, and which they tie to the Girdle behind, in which they do in ſome ſort reſemble our Breeches. The other end of the <hi>Pagne</hi> hangs before, and as they have no Pockets, they do frequently tye thereunto their Purſe for the <hi>Betel,</hi> after the manner that we tye any thing in the corner of our Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif. They do ſometimes alſo wear two <hi>Pagnes</hi> one over the other, to the end that the uppermoſt may ſit more neat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Nakedneſs almoſt entire.</note>Excepting the <hi>Pagne,</hi> the Women go all naked, for they have no Muſlin Shifts, only the Rich do conſtantly wear a Scarf. They do ſometimes wrap the ends thereof about their Arms; but the beſt Air for them, is to put it ſingly over their Boſom at the middle, to make ſmooth the wrinkles thereof, and to let the two ends hang down behind over their Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Modeſty in this Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>Nevertheleſs ſo great a Nudity renders them not immodeſt. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Men and Women of this Country are the moſt ſcrupulous in the world of ſhewing the parts of their Body, which Cuſtom obliges them to conceal. The Women who ſat ſtooping in their <hi>Balons</hi> the day of the King's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's Entry, turn'd for the moſt part their Backs to the Show, and the moſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hardly look'd over their Shoulder. 'Twas neceſſary to give the <hi>French</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſome <hi>Pagnes</hi> to waſh in, to remove the Complaints which theſe People made, at ſeeing them go all naked into the River.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98501:21"/>The Infants go there without a <hi>Pagne</hi> to four or five years of age, but when once of that age, they are never uncover'd to chaſtiſe them; and in the Eaſt it is an exceeding Infamy to be beaten naked on the parts of the Body, which are generally conceal'd.</p>
                     <p>'Tis from hence perhaps,<note place="margin">Why they chaſtiſe with the Cudgel.</note> that the uſe of the Cudgel ſprang up amongſt them in chaſtiſing, by reaſon that neither the Whip, nor the Rod, would be ſufficiently felt through their Cloaths.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, they pluck not off their Cloaths to lie down,<note place="margin">Modeſty in the Bed, and alſo in the Bath.</note> or at leaſt they only change the <hi>Pagne,</hi> as they do to bathe themſelves in the River. The Women bathe themſelves like the Men, and do exerciſe themſelves in ſwimming; and in no part of the world do they ſwim better.</p>
                     <p>Their Modeſty renders the Cuſtom of Bathing almoſt inſupportable unto them, and few amongſt them can reſolve to do it.<note place="margin">Other Proofs of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</note> They have affixt Infamy to Nakedneſs: And they are no leſs careful about the Modeſty of the Ears, than of the Eyes; ſeeing that impure and baudy Songs are prohibited by the Laws of <hi>Siam,</hi> as well as by thoſe of <hi>China.</hi> Yet I cannot affirm that they may not be us'd at all; for the Laws prohibit no other, than the Exceſs already too much eſtabliſh'd: And from <hi>China</hi> there comes ſome Porcelane Figures and Paintings ſo immodeſt, that they are no more permitted than the Baudieſt Songs.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>Pagnes</hi> that are of an extraordinary beauty and gaudineſs,<note place="margin">What <hi>Pagnes</hi> are permitted.</note> as thoſe of Silk with Embroidery, or without Embroidery, and thoſe of painted Linnen very fine, are permitted to thoſe only to whom the Prince preſents them. The Women of Quality do greatly eſteem the black <hi>Pagnes,</hi> and their Scarf is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of plain white Muſlin.</p>
                     <p>They wear Rings on the three laſt Fingers of each Hand,<note place="margin">Rings, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Pendants.</note> and the Faſhion permits them to put on as many as poſſibly can be kept on. They freely give half a Crown for Rings with falſe Stones, which at <hi>Paris</hi> coſt not above two Sols. They have no Necklaces to adorn their Necks, nor their Wives; but the Women and Children of both Sexes wear Pendants. They are generally of Gold, Silver, or Vermilion gilt, in the ſhape of a Pear. The young Boys and Girls of a good Family have Bracelets, but only to ſix or ſeven years of Age; and they equally wear them on their Arms and Legs. They are Rings of Gold, or Silver, or Vermilion gilt.</p>
                     <p>As theſe People have their Body of another Colour than ours,<note place="margin">Their Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſurprizeth not.</note> it ſeems that our Eyes do not think them Naked, at leaſt their Nakedneſs has nothing which ſurprized me; whereas a Naked White Man, when I met one, always appear'd a new Object unto me.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> are rather Small, than Great;<note place="margin">The Statute of the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes.</hi>
                        </note> but their Bodies are well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd, which I principally attribute to their not ſwadling in their Infancy. The care that we take to form the ſhape of our Children, is not always ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, as the liberty which they leave to Nature to proceed in forming theirs. 'Tis true, that the Breaſts of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Women uphold not themſelves from their Childhood, and hang down rather to their Navel; but otherwiſe, their Body is well proportioned, and their hanging Breaſts offend not the Eyes of their Husbands: ſo true it is that the Phantaſies, even they which ſeem to be moſt natural, do greatly conſiſt in Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>The ſhape of their Faces, as well of the Men as Women,<note place="margin">Their Meen.</note> participate leſs of the Oval, than the Lozenge; it is broad and high at the Cheek-bones, and on a ſudden their Forehead contracts and terminates almoſt as much in a Point, as their Chin. Moreover, their Eyes ſlit a little upwards are ſmall, and not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brisk, and the white thereof is generally yellowiſh. Their Jaws are hollow, by reaſon they are too high above; their Mouths are large, their Lips thick and pale, and their Teeth blacken'd. Their Complexion is groſs, and of a brown mix'd with red, unto which the continual Sun-burning contributes as much as the Birth.</p>
                     <p>The Women uſe neither Paint nor Patches; but I have ſeen a great Lord,<note place="margin">A blue Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour laid on the Body.</note>
whoſe Legs were blu'd with a dull Blue, like that mark which the Gunpowder leaves. They that ſhew'd me it, inform'd me that it was a thing affected by the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98501:22"/>
Great Men, that they had more or leſs blue according to their dignity; and that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> was blu'd from the ſole of his Feet, to the hollow of his Stomach. Others aſſur'd me that it was not out of Grandeur, but Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; and others would make me to doubt whether the King of <hi>Siam</hi> was blue. I know not how it is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Noſe and Ears of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                        </note>The <hi>Siameſes,</hi> as I have ſaid, have their Noſe ſhort and round at the end, and their Ears bigger than ours; and the larger they have them, the more they eſteem them: A Phantaſy common to all the Eaſt, as it appears by all the Statues of Porcelane and other matter, which come from thence. But in this there is a difference amongſt the Orientals; for ſome do ſtretch their Ears at the tip to lengthen them, without boring them any more than is neceſſary to put Pendants therein. Others, after having bor'd them, do by little and little enlarge the hole, to thruſt in bigger and bigger Sticks: And it happens, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Country of <hi>Laos,</hi> that they can almoſt thruſt their Fiſt into the hole, and that the tip of the Ear touches the Shoulders. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have Ears ſomewhat bigger than ours, but naturally and without Artifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Their Hair.</note>Their Hair is black, thick and lank, and both Sexes wear it ſo ſhort, that all round the Head it reaches only to the top of the Ears. Underneath this they are very cloſely ſhaved, and this Faſhion pleaſeth them. The Women raiſe it on their Forehead, yet without faſtning it again; and ſome, eſpecially the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins,</hi> do let it grow behind, to wreath it. The young unmarried wear it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a particular manner. They cut with Sciſſars very cloſe the Crown of the Head, and then all round they pull off a ſmall Circle of Hair about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of two Crown-pieces, and underneath they let the reſt of their Hair grow down almoſt to their Shoulders. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of the heat, do thus frequently ſhave the Crown of their Head, but they pluck off no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Fancy of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> for white Women.</note>Now every one being in love with the things of his own Country, I doubted not but the Pictures of ſome of the moſt beautiful perſons of the Court, which I had brought into this Country, would raviſh the <hi>Siameſes</hi> into admiration. The painting thereof was better than that of thoſe little Pictures which are daily ſent into Foreign Countries; yet it muſt be confeſs'd that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> hardly conſider'd them, and that after the Pictures of the Royal Family, before which they reſpectively bowed themſelves, not daring ſtedfaſtly to behold them, they exceedingly eſteemed that of the Duke of <hi>Montauzier,</hi> by reaſon of his high and warlike Meen. We asked two young <hi>Mandarins</hi> what they thought of a great Puppet or Baby, that we ſhew'd them. One of them reply'd, that a Woman like this would be worth an hundred <hi>Catis,</hi> or fifteen thouſand Livres, and his Companion was of the ſame mind; but he added, that there was not any perſon at <hi>Siam</hi> that could purchaſe it. Whether they put ſo high a value on a white Woman, either for the ſingular delight which they take in them, or only by reaſon that whatever comes from far, ought to be very dear, I leave to be determin'd. 'Tis certain, that whether it be Fancy, or Grandeur, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has ſome white <hi>Mingrelian,</hi> or <hi>Georgian</hi> Women, which he purchaſes in <hi>Perſia:</hi> And the <hi>Siameſes</hi> that had been in <hi>France</hi> acknowledg'd, that tho' they were not at firſt very much ſtruck either with the whiteneſs, or with the features of the <hi>French</hi> Women, yet they preſently apprehended that they alone were handſom, and that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> were not. As to the habit of the Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the two <hi>Mandarins</hi> abſolutely contemn'd it, as too intricate and troubleſom for the Husband that would pull it off from his Wife: And I have ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that they imagin'd perhaps that our Wives lay in their Cloaths, like theirs, which would doubtleſs be very troubleſom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> are very neat.</note>As the Cloaths imbibe whatever the Body tranſpires, it is certain that the leſs one is cloath'd, the more eaſie it is to be neat, as the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are. They perfume themſelves in ſeveral places of their Body. On their Lips they put a ſort of perfum'd Pomatum, which makes them appear much paler than naturally they are. They bathe themſelves three or four times a day, or oftner, and it is one of their Neatneſſes not to make a Viſit of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence without bathing; and in this caſe they make a white ſpot on the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98501:22"/>
top of their Breaſt with a piece of Chalk, to ſhew that they came from the Bath.</p>
                     <p>They bathe themſelves two ways,<note place="margin">Two ways of Bathing.</note> either by going into the water after our faſhion, or by cauſing water to be pour'd over their Body with Ladles; and they ſometimes continue this ſort of Bathing for an hour. In a word, they need not to warm the water for their Domeſtic Baths, no notwithſtanding it has been kept ſeveral days, and in Winter; it always continues naturally hot.</p>
                     <p>They take care of their Teeth, altho' they black them:<note place="margin">The Neatneſs of their Teeth and Hair.</note> they waſh their Hair with Water and ſweet Oils, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do, and they uſe no more Powder than they; but they comb themſelves, which moſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do not. They have Combs from <hi>China,</hi> which inſtead of being all of a piece like ours, are only a great many Points or Teeth tied cloſe together with Wire. They pluck their Beard, and naturally have little; but they cut not their Nails, they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd to keep them neat.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw ſome Dancers by Profeſſion, who, for Beauty,<note place="margin">An Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for long Nails.</note> had put on very long Copper Nails, which made them appear like Harpies. At <hi>China,</hi> at leaſt before the Conqueſt of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Cuſtom was neither to cut the Nails, nor the Hair, nor the Beard. The Men wore on their Heads a Net of Hair or Silk, which they faſten'd behind; and which not covering the top of the Head, left a ſpace, through which they pull'd out their Hair, and then wreath'd and faſten'd it with a Bodkin. And it is ſaid that this Dreſs on which they ſometimes alſo wore Bonnets, or a kind of Hats, did cauſe Megrims, and other very violent pains in their Head.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Houſes of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and of their Architecture in Publick Buildings.</head>
                     <p>IF the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are plain in their Habits, they are not leſs in their Houſes,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> keep the ſame Simplicity in every thing.</note> in their Furniture, and in their Food: Rich in a general Poverty, becauſe they know how to content themſelves with a little. Their Houſes are ſmall, but ſurrounded with pretty large Grounds. Hurdles of cleft Bambou, oftentimes not cloſe compacted, do make the Floors, Walls and Roofs thereof. The Piles, on which they are erected to avoid the Inundation, are Bambou's as thick as one's Leg, and about 13 Foot above the Ground, by reaſon that the Waters do ſometimes riſe as much as that. There never is more than four or ſix, on which they do lay other Bambou's acroſs inſtead of Beams. The Stairs are a Ladder of Bambou, which hangs on the outſide like the Ladder of a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill. And by reaſon that their Stables are alſo in the Air, they have Climbers made of Hurdles, by which the Cattle enter therein.</p>
                     <p>If every Houſe ſtands ſingle, 'tis rather for the privacy of the Family,<note place="margin">Houſes ſoon built.</note> which would be diſcover'd through ſuch thin Walls, than for fear of Fire: For beſides that, they make their little Fire in the Courts and not in the Houſes, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them in any caſe to conſume any great matter. Three hundred Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which were burnt at <hi>Siam</hi> in our time, were rebuilt in two days. On a time when a Boom was ſhot to pleaſe the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who beheld it at a diſtance, and from one of the Windows of his Palace, it was neceſſary for this purpoſe to remove three Houſes, and the Proprietors had taken and carry'd them away with their Furniture in leſs than an hour. Their Hearth or Chimney is a Basket full of Earth, and ſupported with three Sticks like a Tripode. And thus they place the Fires wherewith they encloſe great ſpaces in the Foreſts for the hunting of the Elephants.</p>

                        <note place="margin">There are no Inns at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note>'Tis in Houſes of this Nature, or rather in theſe ſorts of Tents, but bigger, that they lodged us along the River. They had built them purpoſely for us, by reaſon there are not any wherein they could lodge us. There are no Inns at <hi>Siam,</hi> nor in any State of <hi>Aſia.</hi> But in <hi>Turkey, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Mogul</hi> there are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravanſera's</hi> for Travellers, that is to ſay public Buildings without Furniture, in which the <hi>Caravans</hi> may ſhelter themſelves, and here every one eats and lies according to the Proviſions and Conveniences which he carries thither. In the Road from <hi>Siam</hi> to <hi>Louvo,</hi> I ſaw a Hall for this uſe. 'Tis a ſpace about the bigneſs of an ordinary Hall, encloſed with a Wall about, as high as one may eaſily lean over, and covered with a Roof, which is laid upon wooden Pillars ſet at equal diſtances in the wall. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> does ſometimes dine there in his Travels, but as for particular perſons, their Boats ſerve them for their Inn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſpitality why unknown amongſt the People of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi>
                        </note>Hoſpitality is a Vertue unknown in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which in my opinion proceeds from the care that every one takes to conceal his Wives. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> practiſe it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the Beaſts, which they freely ſuccour in their Diſtreſſes: But the <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poins</hi> having no Wives, they are more hoſpitable than the People. At <hi>Siam</hi> was a <hi>French</hi> man who reſolv'd to keep an Inn there; and ſome <hi>Europeans</hi> only did ſometimes go thither. And although amongſt the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> it be an eſtabliſhed practice to entertain one another, yet it is rarely in this Country, and with much Ceremony: and eſpecially no open Table is there kept; ſo that it would be difficult to lay out much in keeping a Table, if one would.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What Houſes were purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built for the King's Ambaſſadors.</note>There being no houſe proper for us on the banks of the River, they built ſome after their Country faſhion. Hurdles laid on Piles, and covered with Mats of Bulruſh, did not only make the Floors, but the Area of the Courts. The Hall and Chambers were hung with painted Cloaths, with Cielings of white Muſlin, the extremities of which hung ſloping. The Floors were cover'd with Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, finer and more ſhining than thoſe of the Courts; and in the Chambers where the King's Ambaſſadors lay, Tapeſtry-carpets were laid over the Mats. Neatneſs appeared every where, but no Magnificence. At <hi>Bancok, Siam,</hi> and <hi>Louvo,</hi> where the <hi>Europeans, Chineſes,</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> have built Houſes of Brick, they lodged us in Houſes of this ſort, and not in Houſes purpoſely built for us.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Brick-Houſes for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> which were not Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note>Yet we ſaw two Brick Houſes which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had built, one for the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and the other for thoſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but they are not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; by reaſon perhaps of the little probability there was, that they would be frequently inhabited. Moreover it is certain that this Prince begins ſeveral Brick buildings, and finiſhes few. The reaſon of which I know not.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Europeans, Chineſes,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> do there build with Brick,<note place="margin">Brick-Houſes for Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> every one according to his Genius; for that they alone will be at the expence, as I conceive, or that they alone have the Liberty thereof, as it is reported. At the ſide of their Houſes, to keep off the Sun and not hinder the Air, ſome do add Pent-houſes, which are ſometimes ſupported by Pillars. Others do make the bodies of the Houſe double, which do reciprocally receive the light one from the other, to the end that the Air may paſs from one to the other. The Chambers are large and full of Windows, to be the more freſh and airy. And thoſe of the firſt ſtory have lights over the lower Hall, which ought to be ſo called by reaſon of its heighth, and which ſometimes is almoſt all encloſed with Buildings, through which it receives the light. And 'tis this they call <hi>Divan,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> word which properly ſignifies a <hi>Council-Chamber,</hi> or <hi>Judgement-Hall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are other ſorts of <hi>Divans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Halls called <hi>Divan.</hi>
                        </note> which being built on three ſides do want a fourth Wall, on that ſide which the Sun ſhines leaſt on, in the whole Courſe of the year, for between the Tropicks it illuminates every where according to the ſeveral Seaſons. On the ſide which is open they do put a Pent-houſe, as high as the Roof: and the inſide of the <hi>Divan</hi> is frequently adorn'd from the top to the bottom with little Niches contrived either in the Wall, or in the Wainſcot, in which they put ſome <hi>China</hi> Diſhes. We had a <hi>Divan</hi> of this laſt ſort in our Houſe at <hi>Siam;</hi> and in the Front under the Pent-houſe there played a little Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>The Palaces of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Louvo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Palaces and Temples of Brick, but low.</note> and ſeveral Pagodes or Temples are likewiſe of Brick, but the Palaces are low, by reaſon they have no more than one ſtory, as I have intimated; and the Pagodes are not raiſed high enough in proportion to their bigneſs. They are much darker than our Churches; perhaps becauſe the Obſcurity imprints more reſpect, and ſeems naturally to have ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Moreover they are of the ſhape of our Chappels, but without Vaults, or Cielings; only the Timber-work which ſupports the Tiles, is varniſhed with red interſperſed with ſome ſtreaks of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>China</hi>'s Palace is ſtill of Wood;<note place="margin">Brick-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings modern at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> and this perſwades me that Brick Buildings are very modern at <hi>Siam,</hi> and that the <hi>Europeans</hi> have there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the practice and uſe thereof. And becauſe that the firſt <hi>Europeans,</hi> which have built in this Country, were <hi>Factors,</hi> and have called their Houſes, <hi>Factories;</hi> the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> from the word which in their language ſignifies <hi>Factory,</hi> do likewiſe name their ancienteſt Brick-Pagod, as if they ſhould ſay <hi>Pagode-Factory,</hi> or <hi>Pagode</hi> of the <hi>Factory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word, they know no exterior Ornament for Palaces, nor for Temples,<note place="margin">They know not the five Orders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</note>
ſave in the Roofs, which they cover with that ordinary Tin which they call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> or with Tiles varniſhed with yellow, as it is in the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Palace. But tho there appears not any Gold in the Palace of <hi>Siam</hi> on the outſide, and there is but little gilding on the inſide, yet they fail not to call it <hi>Praſſat-Tong,</hi> or the Golden Palace, becauſe they give pompous names to every thing which they honour. As for what concerns the five Orders of Architecture, compoſed of Columns, Architraves, Frizes, and other Ornaments, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have not any knowledge thereof; and it is not in Ornaments of Architecture, that amongſt them conſiſts the real Dignity of the Royal Houſes and the Temples.</p>
                     <p>Their Stairs are ſo mean, that a pair of Stairs of ten or twelve ſteps,<note place="margin">Stairs and Gates.</note> by which we went up into the Hall of Audience at <hi>Siam,</hi> exceeded not two foot in breadth. They were of Brick joyning to the Wall on the right ſide, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Rail on the left. But the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Lords minded it not; they went up crawling on their Hands and Knees; and ſo ſoftly, that they might have ſaid that they would ſurprize the King their Maſter. The Gate of the Hall being ſquare, but low and ſtrait, was agreeable to the Stairs, and placed on the left
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98501:25"/>
Hand at the Extremity or Corner of the Wall of the Hall. I know not whether they underſtand ſubtilty, and whether they do not believe that a very little Door is too big, ſeeing it is thought that they ought to proſtrate themſelves to enter therein. 'Tis true that the entrance into the Hall of <hi>Louvo</hi> is better, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Fancy; but beſides that, the Palace of <hi>Louvo</hi> is more modern, the Prince does there lay aſide his State, which reſides principally in the Metropolis, as I ſhall relate in the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Wherein the dignity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces conſiſt.</note>That which amongſt them makes the real dignity of the Houſes, is that altho there is no more than one ſtory, yet they are not all level. As for example, in the Palace, the King and Lady's Apartment is higher than the reſt, and the nearer an Apartment is to it, the higher it is in reſpect to another, which is further diſtant: So that there is always ſome ſteps to aſcend from one to the other: For they all joyn to one another, and the whole is from end to end on a line; and it is that which cauſes the inequality in the Roofs. The Roofs are all high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridged, but the one is lower than the other; as it covers a part lower than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And a lower Roof ſeems to come out from a higher Roof, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to bear on the loweſt, like a Saddle, the fore-bow of which bears on the hind part of another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſame at <hi>China.</hi>
                        </note>In the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Palace it is the ſame: And this inequality of the Roofs, which ſeems to proceed one from under another, after the manner that I have explain'd it, denotes grandeur, in that it ſuppoſes an inequality of parts, which is not found in theſe Countries, at leaſt in conſiderable number, but at the King's Houſes; to the end that the further one is permitted to go into this ſet of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the more indeed he aſcends, and the greater diſtinction he perceives. The great Officers will have three parts, one higher than another, which are divided by three Roofs of different elevation: But at the Palace of the City of <hi>Siam</hi> I have ſeen ſeven Roofs proceeding one from under another before the Building: I know not whether there were not others behind. Some ſquare Towers, which are in the Palace, do ſeem alſo to have ſeveral Roofs, one three, another five, another ſeven, as if they were ſquare Goblets laid one upon another; and in one of theſe Towers is a very great Drum headed with an Elephants Skin, to beat the <hi>Tocſin</hi> or Alarum in caſe of need.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſame in the Temples or Pagodes.</note>As to the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> in thoſe that I have ſeen, I obſerved only one ſingle Pent-houſe before, and another behind. The higheſt Roof is that under which the Idol ſtands, the other two which are lower, are thought to be only for the People; although the People forbear not to enter every where on the days when the Temple is open.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Pyramids.</note>But the Principal Ornament of the Pagodes, is to be accompanied, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they are, with ſeveral Pyramids of Lime and Brick, the Ornaments of which are very groſly performed. The higheſt are as high as our ordinary Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the loweſt not exceeding two Fathom. They are all round, and do little diminiſh in bigneſs as they riſe; ſo that they terminate like a Dome: It is true that when they are very low, there proceeds from this Dome-like extremity a Tin Spire very ſmall and ſharp pointed, and high enough in relation to the reſt of the Pyramid. Some there are which diminiſh and grow thick again four or five times in their heighth, ſo that the Profile of them goes waving: But theſe Bellyings out are ſmaller as they are in a higher part of the Pyramid. They are adorn'd in three or four places of their Contour, with ſeveral Furrows or Flutings at Right Angles, as well as in that they have ſome hollow, as in that they have ſome raiſed, which diminiſhing gradually in proportion to the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Pyramid, do run terminating in a point at the beginning of the next bellying out, from whence do again ariſe new Flutings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Deſcription of certain Halls of the Palace.</note>I cannot tell what the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Apartments are; I have only ſeen the firſt piece thereof, which is the Hall of Audience at <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Louvo.</hi> 'Tis ſaid that no perſon enters further, not the King's Domeſticks themſelves, excepting his Wives and Eunuch; in which, if it is true, this Prince maintains a greater heighth than the King of <hi>China.</hi> I likewiſe ſaw the Council-chamber in the Palace of <hi>Louvo;</hi> but it was alſo a firſt Room of another Pile of Building, I mean that it was not preceeded by any Anti-Chamber. At the Front and two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98501:25"/>
ſides of this Hall lyes a Terraſs, which commands as well over the Garden which environs it, as it is commanded by the Hall; and it is on this Terraſs, and under a Canopy, purpoſely erected on the North-ſide, that the King's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were at a private Audience, which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> gave them; and this Prince was in a Chair of State at one of the Hall Windows. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Garden and in the Courts there are ſome ſingle open Rooms, which are called Halls; I mean thoſe ſquare places, that I have already deſcribed, which incloſed with a Wall, no higher than one may lean over, and cover'd with a Roof, which bears only upon Pillars placed at equal diſtances in the Wall. Theſe Halls are for the chief <hi>Mandarins,</hi> who do there ſit croſs-legg'd, either for the Functions of their Offices, or to make their Court, or to expect the Prince's Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Morning very late, and in the Evening until the approach of the Night, and they ſtir not thence without Order. The leſs conſiderable <hi>Mandarins</hi> ſit in the open Air, in the Courts or Gardens; and when they know by certain ſignals that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſees them, altho he be inviſible, they do all proſtrate themſelves on their Hands and Knees.</p>
                     <p>When we din'd in the Palace of <hi>Siam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The places of the Palace where we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 'twas in a very pleaſant place under great Trees, and at the ſide of a ſtore-pond, wherein it was ſaid that amongſt ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh there are ſome which reſemble a Man and Woman; but I ſaw none of any ſort. In the Palace of <hi>Louvo</hi> we dined in the Garden, in a ſingle Hall, the Walls of which ſupported the Roof. They are plaiſtered with a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extremely white, ſmooth, and ſhining, upon occaſion of which it was told us there was much better made at <hi>Suratt.</hi> The Hall has a Door at each end, and is encompaſt with a Ditch between two or three Fathoms in breadth, and perhaps one in depth, in which there are twenty little <hi>Jet-deaus,</hi> at equal diſtances. They play like a watering pot, pierced with ſeveral very little holes, and they ſpurt no higher than the edge of the Ditch, or thereabouts, becauſe that inſtead of raiſing the Water, they have dug away the Earth to make the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons low.</p>
                     <p>The Garden is not very ſpacious:<note place="margin">The Garden of <hi>Louvo.</hi>
                        </note> the Compartments and Borders thereof are very little and formed by Bricks laid edgeways. The Paths between the Borders cannot contain two a breſt, nor the Walks more: But the whole being planted with Flowers, and ſeveral ſorts of Palmites and other Trees, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Hall, and Fountains, had I know not what Air of Simplicity and Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cauſed Delight. 'Tis a remarkable thing that theſe Princes ſhould never be inclined to uſe Magnificence in their Gardens; altho from all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Orientals have admired them.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> exerciſing the Chace ſometimes for ſeveral days,<note place="margin">Palaces of Bambou in the Woods.</note> there are in the Woods ſome Palaces of Bambou, or if you pleaſe, ſome fixed Tents, which only need furniſhing to receive him. They are red on the outſide, like thoſe of the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> when he goes into the Country, and like the Walls which ſerve as an Incloſure for the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Palace. I have given the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del thereof, not only that the Simplicity of it may be ſeen, but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome aſſur'd me that the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Apartments, in his Palaces of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> and <hi>Louvo</hi> is according to the ſame Model. 'Tis only a little Dormitory, where the King and his Wives have each a little Cell: Nevertheleſs the truth of what few perſons do ſee, is always hard to know. However ſome alſo aſſur'd me concerning this Prince, what I have heard reported of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> which is that for fear of being ſurprized by any Conſpiracy, this Prince hath ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments wherein he locks himſelf at night, it being impoſſible to divine exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in which he lyes. <hi>Strabo</hi> reports of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings in his time, that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon obliged them to change their Bed and Apartment ſeveral times in the ſame Night.

                        <note place="margin">Their groſs Houſhold-ſtuff.</note>THeir Bedſtead is a wooden Frame very ſtrait and matted, but without Head or Poſts. It has ſometimes ſix Feet, which are not joined by croſs pieces, ſometimes it has none at all; but the generality have no other Bed than a Matt of Bulruſh. Their Table is like a Drum-head with the Edges raiſed, and without Feet. They have at Table neither Cloth nor Napkin, nor Spoon, nor Fork, nor Knife, they are ſerv'd with Morſels ready cut. No Seats, but Bulruſh Matts, finer or courſer: No Carpets, when the Prince gives them not to them: And thoſe of fine Cloth are very honourable, by reaſon of the dearneſs thereof. The Rich have Cuſhions to lean on, but they uſe them not to ſit on, not the King himſelf. That which amongſt us is of Stuff or Wooll, or Silk, is generally amongſt them of white or painted Cotton.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their Veſſels.</note>Their Veſſels are either of Porcelane, or Potter's Clay, with ſome Veſſels of Copper. Wood plain, or varniſh'd, <hi>Coco</hi> and <hi>Bambou</hi> afford them all the reſt If they have any Veſſel of Gold or Silver, 'tis very little, and almoſt only by the Liberality of the Prince, and as a Chattel belonging to their Offices. Their Buckets to draw up Water are of <hi>Bambou,</hi> very neatly woven. In the Markets the People are ſeen to boil their <hi>Rice</hi> in a <hi>Coco,</hi> and the <hi>Rice</hi> to be ſufficiently dreſt, before the <hi>Coco</hi> begins to burn; but the <hi>Coco</hi> ſerves no more than once.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their Tools.</note>In ſhort, every one builds his Houſe, if he cauſeth it not to be built by his Slaves; and for this Reaſon the Saw and the Plane are every ones Tools. At the end of this Volume the moſt Curious will find a Liſt, which two <hi>Mandarins</hi> gave me of the ordinary Moveables in their Families. 'Tis not that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon has ſo many, but perhaps none has more. They do there add the names of the principal parts of a Houſe, of their Habits, and of their Arms. There may be ſeen the plain, but neat manner after which they built, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht themſelves with Moveables; and ſeveral particulars of their Manners, which I there relate upon the occaſion of certain Moveables.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The King's Furniture.</note>Their King's Furniture is almoſt the ſame, but richer and more precious than thoſe of particular perſons. The Halls, which I ſaw at the Palaces of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Louvo,</hi> are all Wainſcoted, and the Wainſcot is varniſh'd Red, with ſome ſtreaks and foliages of Gold. The Floors were cover'd with Carpets. The Hall of Audience at <hi>Louvo</hi> was all over embelliſh'd with Looking-glaſſes, which the King's Squadron had brought to <hi>Siam.</hi> The Council-Chamber was furniſh'd after this manner. In the Room there was a Sopha made exactly like a great Bedſtead with its Poſts, its Bottom and its Curtain-Rods all cover'd with a Plate of Gold, and the bottom with a Carpet, but without Teſter or Curtains, or any ſort of Garniture; inſtead of the Bolſter there were Cuſhions pil'd, on which the King lean'd, but ſat not thereon, as I have already remark'd, he had only a Carpet under him. In this Hall, at the Wall of the right ſide in relation to the Sopha, there was an excellent Glaſs which the King had ſent to the King of <hi>Siam</hi> by <hi>M. de Chaumont.</hi> There was likewiſe a wooden Chair of State gilded, in which this Prince ſhew'd himſelf to the King's Ambaſſadors at a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which I have mention'd; and a <hi>Tiab</hi> or Cup to put <hi>Betel</hi> in, about two Foot high, or thereabouts, and cas'd with Silver curiouſly wrought, and gilded in ſome places.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Table-Plate which we ſaw at the King's Palace.</note>In all the Entertainments which we receiv'd at the Palace, we ſaw great ſtore of Silver Plate, eſpecially great Baſons round and deep, with a Brim about a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's breadth, in which were ſerv'd up great round Boxes about a Foot and an half in Diameter. They were cover'd, and had a Foot proportion'd to their bigneſs, and 'twas in theſe Boxes that the <hi>Rice</hi> was ſerv'd up. For the Fruit they gave us ſome gold Plates, which were reported to have been made purpoſely for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98501:26"/>
the Entertainments which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> made for <hi>M. de Chaumont;</hi> and it is true that this Prince eats not in flat Plate. They eſteem for his Dignity, that the Meſſes which are ſerv'd up to him are only in high Veſſels, and Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane is more common at his Table, than Gold or Silver: A general Cuſtom in all the Courts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and even in that of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the Table of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Table of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> is not ſumptuous:<note place="margin">That the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> eat little, and what their Food is.</note> As we eat leſs in Summer than in Winter, they eat leſs than we, by reaſon of the continual Summer in which they live; their common Food is Rice and Fiſh. The Sea affords them very delicate ſmall Oyſters, very excellent ſmall Turtles, Lobſters of all ſizes, and admirable Fiſh, the ſorts of which are unknown to us. Their River is alſo very plentiful of Fiſh, and principally very good and curious Eels: But they make little eſteem of freſh Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Freſh-water Fiſh, they have ſome little ones of two ſorts,<note place="margin">A Wonder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of two ſorts of Fiſh.</note> which do here deſerve to be mention'd. They call them <hi>Pla out,</hi> and <hi>Pla cadi,</hi> that is to ſay the Fiſh <hi>out,</hi> and the Fiſh <hi>cadi.</hi> To free me from all doubts, ſome have aſſur'd me, that after they have ſalted them together, as the <hi>Siameſes</hi> us'd to do, if they leave them in an earthen Pot in their Pickle, where they ſoon corrupt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſalt ill at <hi>Siam,</hi> then, that is to ſay when they are corrupted, and as it were in a very liquid Paſte, they do exactly follow the flux and reflux of the Sea, growing higher and lower in the Pitcher as the Sea ebbs or flows. Mr. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> gave me a Pot thereof at his arrival in <hi>France,</hi> and aſſur'd me that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment was true, and that he had ſeen it; but I cannot add my Teſtimony thereunto, by reaſon I was too late advertiſed thereof at <hi>Siam,</hi> to have an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of aſcertaining it by my own Eyes; and that the Pot which Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> gave me, and which I brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> perform'd this Effect no more: perhaps becauſe the Fiſh were too much corrupted, or that their virtue of imitating the flux and reflux of the Sea continues only a certain time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> find much difficulty to make good Salt,<note place="margin">Bad Salt at <hi>Siam:</hi> The deſire of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> for corrupt meats.</note> by reaſon that Meats do hardly take Salt in exceſſive hot Countries; but they love Fiſh ill ſeaſon'd and dry better than freſh, even ſtinking Fiſh diſpleaſeth them not no more than rotten Eggs, Locuſts, Rats, Lizards, and moſt Inſects: Nature doubtleſs framing their Appetite to things, the Digeſtion whereof is more eaſie to them. And it may be that all theſe things have not ſuch an ill taſte as we imagine.<note place="margin">Whatever ſmells ill, is not always ill taſted.</note> 
                        <hi>Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette</hi> in Pag. 45. Tom. I. <hi>of his Hiſtorical Diſcourſes of</hi> China, relates that he at firſt exceedingly deteſted the Brooded Eggs of a Bird which he calls <hi>Tabon,</hi> but that when he eat thereof, he found them excellent. 'Tis certain that at <hi>Siam</hi> new-laid Eggs are very unwholſom; we do here eat Vipers, we draw not certain Birds to eat them; and ſometimes Veniſon a little over-hunted is beſt reliſht.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Siameſe</hi> makes a very good Meal with a pound of <hi>Rice</hi> a day,<note place="margin">What a <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe</hi> expends a day in Food.</note> which amounts not to more than a Farthing; and with a little dry or ſalt Fiſh, which coſts not more. The <hi>Arak</hi> or <hi>Rice Brandy</hi> is not worth above two Sols for that quantity, which amounts to a <hi>Pariſian</hi> Pint; after which it is no wonder if the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are not in any great care about their Subſiſtence, and if in the Evening there is heard nothing but Singing in their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>Their Sauces are plain, a little Water with ſome Spices, Garlic, Chibols,<note place="margin">Their Sauces.</note> or ſome ſweet Herb, as Baulm. They do very much eſteem a liquid Sauce, like Muſtard, which is only Cray-Fiſh corrupted, becauſe they are ill ſalted; they call it <hi>Capi.</hi> They gave Mr. <hi>Ceberet</hi> ſome Pots thereof, which had no bad Smell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98501:27"/>
                        <note place="margin">They yellow their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>That which ſerves them inſtead of Saffron is a root, which has the Taſte and Colour thereof when it is dry and reduc'd to Powder: the Plant thereof is known under the Name of <hi>Crocus Indicus.</hi> They account it very wholeſom for their Children, to yellow the Body and Face therewith. So that in the ſtreets there are only ſeen Children with a tawny Complexion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What Oil they eat.</note>They have neither Nuts, nor Olives, nor any eating Oil, ſave that which they extract from the Fruit of <hi>Coco;</hi> which, tho always a little bitter, yet is good, when it is freſh drawn: but it preſently becomes very ſtrong, inſomuch that it is not eatable by ſuch as are not accuſtomed to eat bad Oil. The Taſte is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made, and it happened at my return from a very long Voyage, where I met with no extraordinary Oil, that I found the excellent Oil of <hi>Paris</hi> inſipid and taſteleſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be underſtood with reference to him that writes them.</note>Wherefore I cannot forbear making a remark very neceſſary, truly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Relations of Foreign Countries. 'Tis that the words, <hi>good, excellent, magnificent, great, bad, ugly, ſimple,</hi> and <hi>ſmall;</hi> equivocal in themſelves, muſt always be underſtood with reference to the Phantaſie of the Author of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if otherwiſe he does not particularly explain what he writes. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a <hi>Dutch</hi> Factor, or a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Monk do exaggerate the Magnificence, and good Entertainment of the Eaſt; if the leaſt Houſe of the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Palace appears unto them worthy of an <hi>European</hi> King, it muſt be ſuppoſed that this is true, in reference to the Court of <hi>Portugal.</hi> And yet ſome may doubt hereof, ſeeing that in truth the Apartments of the Palace of <hi>China,</hi> are no other than Wood varniſhed on the inſide and outſide, which is rather agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and neat than magnificent. Thus (becauſe it would not be juſt to contemn every thing, that reſembles not what we do now ſee in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and which was never ſeen before this great and glorious Reign) I have endeavour'd to expreſs nothing in ambiguous Terms, but to deſcribe exactly what I have ſeen, thereby to prevent the ſurpriſing any perſon by my particular Fancy, and to the end that every one make as true a Judgment of what I write, as if he had performed the Voyage that I have done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the ſame Subject.</note>Another defect in Relations is the Tranſlation of the Foreign Words. As for inſtance, amongſt the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Wives, there is only one that hath the Honours and Title of Queen: the reſt are under her, although they be all legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that is to ſay permitted by the Laws of the Country. They are called <hi>verbatim</hi> the <hi>Ladies of the Palace,</hi> and at <hi>Siam</hi> they have the ſame Name. The Children of theſe Ladies honour not their natural Mothers, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are obliged theirs, but they render this Reſpect, and give the Name of Mother to the Queen; as if the ſecond Wives bore Children only for the principal Wife. And this is alſo the Cuſtom at <hi>China,</hi> in the Houſes of private Perſons, who have ſeveral Wives; to the end that there may be an entire ſubordination, which maintains Peace there as much as poſſible. And that the Children be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to diſpute amongſt them the merit of their Mothers. We read almoſt the ſame thing of <hi>Sarah,</hi> who gave <hi>Hagar</hi> her Bond-maid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to have, as ſhe ſaid, ſome Children by her Slave, being paſt Child-bearing her ſelf. Some other Wives of the Patriarchs practiſed the ſame, and it is evident that being the principal Wives, every one was thought the Mother of all her Husband's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But to return to what I have ſpoken concerning the danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Tranſlations of the Foreign words in Relations, who ſees not the Equivocation of theſe words, <hi>the Ladies of the Palace,</hi> put into the mouth of a <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> or in the mouth of a <hi>French-man,</hi> who tranſlates a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Relation of <hi>China?</hi> The ſame Equivocations are found in the names of Offices? Becauſe that all Courts and all Governments do not reſemble. All Functions are not found every where, and the ſame are not every where attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſame Offices, that is to ſay to Offices of the ſame name: beſides that ſuch a Function will be great and conſiderable in one Country, which may be inconſiderable in another. As for example, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Marſhals, which they at firſt deſign'd in imitation of the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> and yet an Ambaſſador would find himſelf exceedingly miſtaken, if being accompanied to the Audience of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by a Marſhal of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98501:27"/>
as highly honoured, as if he were accompany'd to the King's Audience by a Marſhal of <hi>France.</hi> Now the more remote the Courts are, the greater is the defect, when the ſame Words and the ſame <hi>Idea's</hi> are transferred from the one to the other. At <hi>Siam</hi> it is a very honourable Employment to empty the King's Cloſe-ſtool, which is always emptied in a place appointed, and carefully kept for this purpoſe; it may be out of ſome ſuperſtitious Fear of the Sorceries which they imagine may be perform'd on the Excrements. At <hi>China</hi> all the Splendor and Authority is in the Offices which we call the Long Robe: And their Military Officers, at leaſt before the Domination of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of unfortunate Wretches, who were not thought endow'd with Merit ſufficient to raiſe themſelves by Learning.</p>
                     <p>A third defect of Relations is to deſcribe things only in one Particular,<note place="margin">Another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the ſame Subject.</note> if I may ſo ſay. The Reader conceives that in every thing elſe the Nation whereof he is inform'd reſembles his, and that in this only it is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant or admirable. Thus if it be ſimply ſaid, that the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> puts his Shirt over his Veſt, this would appear ridiculous to us; but when the whole is underſtood, it is found, that, tho' all Nations act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on different Principles, the whole amounts almoſt to the ſame; and that there is not in any place any thing marvellous or extravagant. But enough is ſpoken on this Subject, I return to the good Cheer of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have Milk from the Female <hi>Buffalo,</hi> which has more Cream,<note place="margin">The Milk at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> than the Milk of our Cows; but they make not any ſort of Cheeſe, and ſcarce any Butter. Butter does hardly take any Conſiſtence there by reaſon of the Heat; and that which is brought from <hi>Suratt</hi> and <hi>Bengale,</hi> through Climates ſo extreamly hot, is very bad, and almoſt melted in arriving there.</p>
                     <p>They diſguiſe dry Fiſh after ſeveral manners,<note place="margin">How the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> diſguiſe their Meats.</note> without varying the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Example, they will cut it into thin Slices, twiſted like the <hi>Virmicelli</hi> of the <hi>Italians,</hi> or the <hi>oeufs filez</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Chineſes</hi> are ſo addicted to this way of diſguiſing their Meats, that of a Drake, for Example, they will make a Soldier, of an <hi>Ananas</hi> a Dragon, and this Dragon ſhall be painted in ſeveral Colours. Heretofore in <hi>Europe</hi> ſeveral Sugar Figures were ſerv'd up amongſt the Fruit, but they eat them not; and the <hi>Germans</hi> call'd them <hi>Schaw-eſſen,</hi> or <hi>Food to look upon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of more than thirty Diſhes,<note place="margin">A <hi>Chineſe</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</note> wherewith we were ſerved at <hi>Siam</hi> after the Faſhion of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> it was not poſſible for me to eat of one: Altho' it be naturally as eaſie to me as to any other, to accommodate my ſelf to ſtrange Taſtes. At the ſight therefore of ſo ſtrange a Repaſt, I reſted more ſatisfy'd with what ſome report of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> that they taſte, without loathing, the Excrements of Men and other Animals, to chuſe out the moſt proper to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and improve their Lands; and that they commonly eat of all the Viands, which we abhor, as Cats, Dogs, Horſes, Aſſes, Mules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which they are very oppoſite to the <hi>Siameſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do love Fleſh little, and have no Butchers Meat.</note> who do rarely eat of any Fleſh, tho' it be given them. But when they vouchſafe ſo far as to eat thereof, they rather chuſe the Guts, and whatever is moſt loathſom to us in the Inteſtines. In their Bazars or Markets they do ſell Inſects broil'd or roaſted, and they have not any other Roaſt-meat. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> gave us ſome Poultry, and other live Animals, for our Servants to kill and dreſs for our Table. But in general all Food there is tough, Juiceleſs and Crude; and by degrees the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> themſelves, which inhabit at <hi>Siam,</hi> do refrain eating thereof. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> according to <hi>Aelian,</hi> eſteemed not thoſe who preferred Fleſh before Fiſh. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> do eat little, and do eat it dry roaſted; and we find that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> eat too much, and that they eat it too raw: 'Tis that as the Countries are hotter, Sobriety is more natural.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> take no care of Poultry. They have two ſorts of Hens,<note place="margin">The Poultry.</note> ſome are like to ours, others have the Skin and Comb black, but the Fleſh and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98501:28"/>
Bones white; and when theſe black Hens are boil'd, it is impoſſible to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the white ones either by the taſte or colour; altho' there are ſome perſons who generally eſteem the black beſt. Ducks are very plentiful and very good, but 'tis a Food, which, as it is ſaid, does eaſily cloy. The <hi>Indian Cocks</hi> are brought to us from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and there are none at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Game.</note>Peacocks and Pigeons are wild there; all Partridges are gray: Hares are very ſcarce, and no Rabbets to be ſeen. It may be that the Race could not preſerve itſelf in the Woods, amongſt all the carnivorous Animals, wherewith they are ſtored.

                        </note>A thing which will appear ſingular, (altho' it be common at <hi>Braſil,</hi> and it may be in other hot Countries) is, that almoſt all the Birds at <hi>Siam</hi> are beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold, and are all very unpleaſant to hear. There are ſeveral ſorts, which imitate the Voice; all have ſome Cry, but no warbling Note. And tho' in this Country there are ſome of the Birds which we have here, they are, for Example, neither Nightingales nor Canary-Birds, but Sparrows, Peacocks, Crows, and Vultures. The Sparrows do enter boldly into the Chambers, there to pick up the little Inſects, wherewith they ſwarm. The Crows and Vultures are very plentiful, and very familiar; becauſe no perſon frights them, and the people feed them out of Charity. They do generally give them the Children, which die before three or four years old.</p>

Amongſt the moſt dangerous, the moſt frequent are Fluxes and Diſſenteries, from which the <hi>Europeans</hi> that arrive at this Country, have more trouble to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than the Natives of the Country, by reaſon they cannot live ſober enough. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> are ſometimes attackt with burning Fevers, in which the tranſport to the Brain is eaſily formed, with defluxions on the Stomach. Moreover, Inflamations are rare, and the ordinary continual Fever kills none, no more than in the other places of the Torrid Zone: Intermitting Fevers are alſo rare, but violent, tho' the cold Fit be very ſhort. The External does ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98501:28"/>
weaken the Natural Heat, that here are not ſeen almoſt any of thoſe Diſtempers, which our Phyſitians do call Agues: and this is ſo throughout <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where, of an hundred ſick perſons, Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Phyſician, whom I have already mention'd, declar'd that he ſcarce found one which had the Fever, or any other hot diſtemper. Coughs, Coqueluches or Quinancies, and all ſorts of Defluxions and Rheumatiſms are not leſs frequent at <hi>Siam,</hi> than in theſe Countries; and I wonder not thereat, ſeeing that the weather is inclined to Rain ſo great a part of the year: but the Gout, Epilepſy, Apoplexy, Pthyſick, and all ſorts of Cholick, eſpecially the Stone, are very rare.</p>
                     <p>There are a great many <hi>Cankers, Abceſſes,</hi> and <hi>Fiſtula's.

The ill conſequences of a debauch are here very frequent, but they know not whether they are ancient or modern in their Country.</p>
                     <p>In a word, there are ſome contagious diſeaſes,<note place="margin">What is the Plague at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi>
                        </note> but the real Plague of this Country is the Small Pox: It oftentimes makes dreadful ravage, and then they interr the bodies without burning them: but becauſe their Piety always makes them deſire to render them this laſt reſpect, they do afterwards dig them up again: and that which exceedingly ſurprizes me, is, that they dare not do it till three years after, or longer, by reaſon, as they ſay, that they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that this Contagion breaks out afreſh, if they dig them up ſooner.</p>

The Hunting of Elephants is free for all, but they purſue this Chaſe only to catch them, and never to kill them. They never cut them, but for ordinary ſervice they uſe only the Female Elephants: the Males they deſign for the War. Their Country is not proper for the breeding of Horſes, or they know not how to breed them: but I believe alſo that their Paſtures are too courſe and mooriſh, to give Courage and Mettle to their Horſes; and this is the reaſon that they need not to cut them to render them more tractable. They have neither Aſſes nor Mules; but the <hi>Moors</hi> which are ſettled at <hi>Siam,</hi> have ſome Camels, which come to them from abroad.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> only keeps about two thouſand Horſes:<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Horſes.</note> He has a dozen of <hi>Perſian,</hi> which are now nothing worth. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſador preſented them to him about four or five years ſince, from the King his Maſter. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily he ſends to buy ſome Horſes at <hi>Batavia,</hi> where they are all ſmall and very brisk, but as reſty as the <hi>Javan</hi> people are mutinous; either for that the Country makes them ſo, or that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> know not to manage them.</p>
                     <p>I have more than once ſeen in the ſtreets of <hi>Batavia</hi> the Burgeſſes of the City on Horſeback; but in an inſtant their Ranks were broken,<note place="margin">The Cavalry and Infantry of <hi>Batavia.</hi>
                        </note> by reaſon that moſt of their Horſes would ſtop on a ſudden, and would refuſe to march: and mine Hoſt hereupon inform'd me, that the common fault of the <hi>Javan</hi> Horſes was to prove very reſty. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company maintain Infantry at <hi>Batavia,</hi> amongſt which there is a good number of <hi>French.</hi> As for what concerns the Cavalry, there is no other than the Burgeſſes, who notwithſtanding the heat of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, do cloath themſelves with good Buff, with rich trappings embroider'd with Gold and Silver. No Burgher ſerves in the Infantry: but if a Souldier demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98501:29"/>
that he has wherewith to ſettle and maintain himſelf at <hi>Batavia,</hi> either by a Marriage or a Trade, they never refuſe him neither his liberty, nor his right of Burgherſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> rides lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or not at all on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</note>When we arriv'd there were two <hi>Siameſes</hi> to buy two hundred Horſes for the King their Maſter, about an hundred and fifty of which they had already ſent away for <hi>Siam.</hi> 'Tis not that this Prince loves to ride on Horſeback; this way ſeems to him both too mean and of too little defence: for the Elephant appears to them much more proper for Battel, though when all comes to all, it may reaſonably be doubted whether he be more proper for War, as I ſhall ſhow in the ſequel. They report that this Animal knows how to defend his Maſter, and to ſet him upon his back again with his Trunk, if he is faln, and to throw his Enemy on the ground. When the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſeiz'd on the Crown, the King his Unkle fled from the Palace on an Elephant, and not on Horſeback, altho a Horſe ſeems much properer to fly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A Guard Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in the Palace.</note>In the Palace there is always an Elephant on the Guard, that is to ſay Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed and ready to mount, and no Guard-Horſe.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> never ſeen on Foot.</note>In this place of the Palace where the Guard-Elephant ſtands, there is a little Scaffold, to which the King walks from his Apartment, and from this Scaffold he eaſily gets upon his Elephant. But if he would be carry'd in a Chair by men, which he ſometimes is, he comes to this ſort of carriage, at the due heighth of placing himſelf therein, either by a Window or a Terrace, and by this means neither his Subjects nor Strangers do ever ſee him on Foot. This Honour is only reſerved for his Wives and Eunuchs, when he is lock'd up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Palace.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their Sedans.</note>Their Chairs or Sedans are not like ours, they are ſquare and flat Seats, more or leſs elevated, which they place and fix on Biers. Four or eight men (for the Dignity herein conſiſts in the Number) do carry them on their naked Shoulders, one or two to each Staff, and other men relieve theſe. Sometimes theſe Seats have a Back and Arms like our Chairs of State, and ſometimes they are ſimply compaſt, except before, with a ſmall Balliſter about half a Foot high; but the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do always place themſelves croſs-legged. Sometimes theſe Seats are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſometimes they have an Imperial; and theſe Imperials are of ſeveral ſorts, which I will deſcribe in ſpeaking of the Balons, in the middle of which they do likewiſe place theſe Seats, as well as on the backs of Elephants.</p>

At the ſides and behind do riſe up to the top of his Shoulders three great Foliages, or Feathers gilt, and bent outwards at the Point: but when this Prince ſtops, a Footman, who ſtands ten or twelve paces from him, ſhelters him from the Sun with a very high Umbrella like a Pike, with the Head three or four Foot in Diameter: and this is not a ſmall fatigue, when the Wind blows thereon. This ſort of Umbrella, which is only for the King, is called <hi>Pat-boouk.</hi>

                     <p>But becauſe that in this Country they go more by Water than by Land,<note place="margin">The Carriage of the <hi>Balons.</hi>
                        </note> the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has very fine <hi>Balons.</hi> I have already ſaid that the Body of a <hi>Balon</hi> is compoſed only of one ſingle Tree, ſometimes from ſixteen to twenty Fathom in length. Two men ſitting croſs-leg'd by the ſide one of another, on a Plank laid acroſs, are ſufficient to take up the whole breadth thereof. The one <hi>Pagayes</hi> at the right, and the other on the left ſide. <hi>Pagayer</hi> is to row with the <hi>Pagaye,</hi> and the <hi>Pagaye</hi> is a ſhort Oar, which one holds with both hands, by the middle, and at the end. It ſeems that he can only ſweep the water though with force. It is not fixed to the edge of the <hi>Balon,</hi> and he that manages it, looks where he goes; whereas he that rows, turns his back to his Road.</p>
                     <p>In a ſingle <hi>Balon</hi> there are ſometimes an hundred,<note place="margin">An exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a <hi>Balon.</hi>
                        </note> or an hundred and twenty <hi>Pagayeurs,</hi> thus ranged two and two with their Legs croſſed on Plancks: but the inferior Officers have <hi>Balons</hi> a great deal ſhorter, where few <hi>Pagayes</hi> or <hi>Oars,</hi> as ſixteen, or twenty do ſuffice. The <hi>Pagayeurs</hi> or Rowers, do ſtrike the <hi>Pagaye</hi> in Conſort, do ſing, or make ſome meaſured Noiſes; and they plunge the <hi>Pagaye</hi> in a juſt cadence with a motion of the Arms and Shoulders, which is vigorous, but eaſy, and graceful. The weight of this Bank of Oars ſerves as Ballaſt to the <hi>Balon,</hi> and keeps it almoſt even with the water, which is the reaſon that the <hi>Pagayes</hi> are very ſhort. And the Impreſſion which the <hi>Balon</hi> receives from ſo many men which vigorouſly plunge the <hi>Pagaye</hi> at the ſame time, makes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways totter with a motion which pleaſes the Eye, and which is obſerv'd much more at the Poop and Prow; becauſe they are higher, and like to the Neck and Tail of ſome of Dragon, or ſome monſtrous Fiſh, of which the <hi>Pagayes</hi> on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſhew like the Wings or the Fins. At the Prow one ſingle <hi>Pagayeur</hi> takes up the firſt Rank, without having any Comrade at his ſide. He has not room enough to croſs his left Leg with his right, and he is forced to ſtretch it out over an end of a ſtick, which proceeds from the ſide of the Prow. 'Tis this firſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayeur</hi> that gives the motion to all the reſt. His <hi>Pagaye</hi> is ſomewhat longer, by reaſon that he is poſted in that place where the Prow begins to riſe, and that he is ſo much the further from the Water. He plunges the <hi>Pagaye</hi> once to every meaſure, and when it is neceſſary to go ſwifter he plunges it twice; and lifting up the <hi>Pagaye</hi> continually, and only for decency with a ſhout, he throws the water a great way, and the next ſtroak all the Equipage imitates him. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot ſtands always at the Poop, where it riſes exceedingly. The Rudder is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long <hi>Pagaye,</hi> which is not fixed to the <hi>Balon,</hi> and to which the Steerſman ſeems to give no other Motion, than to keep it truly perpendicular in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and againſt the edge of the <hi>Balon</hi> ſometimes on the right ſide, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the left. The Women Slaves do row the Ladies <hi>Balons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Balons</hi> of ordinary ſervice, wherein there are fewer <hi>Pagayeurs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Several ſorts of <hi>Balons.</hi>
                        </note> there is in the middle a Cabin of <hi>Bambou,</hi> or other Wood, without Painting or Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, in which a whole Family may be held, and ſometimes this Cabin has a lower Pent-houſe be fore, under which the Slaves are; and many of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have no other Habitation. But in the <hi>Balons</hi> of Ceremony, or in thoſe of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s body, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have called <hi>Balons of State,</hi> there is in the middle but one Seat, which takes up almoſt the whole breadth of the <hi>Balon,</hi> and wherein there is only one Perſon and his Arms, the Sabre and Lance. If it is an ordinary <hi>Mandarin,</hi> he has only a ſingle Umbrella like ours to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if it is a more conſiderable <hi>Mandarin,</hi> beſides that his Seat is higher, he is covered with what the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> call <hi>Chirole,</hi> and the <hi>Siameſes Coup.</hi> 'Tis an Arbor all open before and behind, made of <hi>Bambous</hi> cleft and interlac'd, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd within and without with a black or red Varniſh. The red Varniſh is for the <hi>Mandarins</hi> at the right hand, the black for thoſe of the left, a diſtinction which I ſhall explain in its due place. Beſides this the extremities of the <hi>Chirole</hi> are gilded on the outſide the breadth of three or four Inches, and ſome pretend that 'tis in the faſhion of theſe gildings, which are not plain, but like Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, that the Marks of the <hi>Mandarins</hi> Dignity are.

                     <p>Whilſt the King of <hi>Siam</hi> is in his Metropolis,<note place="margin">When and how the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſhews himſelf.</note> the ancient cuſtom of his Court requires that he ſhow himſelf to the people five or ſix days of the year only, and that he does it with Pomp. Heretofore the Kings his Predeceſſors did firſt break up the ground every year, till they left this Function to the <hi>Oc-ya-kaou;</hi> and it was attended with great Splendor. They alſo went out another day to perform on the water another Ceremony, which was not leſs ſuperſtitious, nor leſs ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. 'Twas to conjure the River to return into its Channel, when the Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requir'd it, and when the Wind inclining to the North aſſured the return of fair weather. The preſent King was the firſt that diſpenc'd with this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom work, and it is ſeveral years ſince it ſeem'd aboliſhed; becauſe, ſay they, that the laſt time he perform'd it, he had the diſgrace of being ſurpriz'd with rain, altho his Aſtrologers had promiſed him a fair day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</hi> relates that in his time the King of <hi>Siam</hi> uſed to ſhew himſelf one day in a year upon his white Elephant, to ride through nine ſtreets of the City, and to extend great Liberalities to the People. This Ceremony, if it has been in uſe, is now aboliſhed. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> never mounts the white Elephant, and the reaſon which they give is, that the white Elephant is as great a Lord as himſelf, becauſe he has a King's ſoul like him. Thus this Prince ſhews himſelf in his Metropolis no more than twice a year, at the beginning of the ſixth and twelfth month, to go and preſent Alms of Silver, yellow <hi>Pagnes</hi>—, and fruits to the <hi>Talapoins</hi> of the Principal Pagods. On theſe days, which the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> do call <hi>Van pra, a holy, or excellent day,</hi> he goes upon an Elephant to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes which are in the ſame City, and by water to another, which is about two leagues from the City down the River. On the days following he ſends the like Alms to the leſs conſiderable Pagods: but this extends not above two leagues from the Metropolis, or thereabouts. And in the laſt month of the year 1687, this Prince went no where in perſon; he contented himſelf with ſending every where.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſhews himſelf in his Metropolis, 'tis upon ſome Ceremonies of Religion, At <hi>Louvo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> lives with leſs pomp at <hi>Louvo</hi> than at <hi>Sam</hi>

The <hi>Neiras</hi> I call Nobles, who alone make profeſſion of Arms, and who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves defiled, when they touch a Ploughman. At <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>China</hi> the principal Magiſtrates have Officers that go before them, who make the People to ſtand in Ranks, and who would cudgel thoſe that would not retire, or which would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98501:32"/>
not render to their Maſter all the other reſpects which are due unto him, and which in theſe Countries we found very inſupportable. 'Tis no wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the King of <hi>China,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the other <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Potentates have thought it conſiſtent with their Dignity, thus to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the People of their March.

'Tis upon the ſame account, that is to ſay, to diſperſe the People from the perſon of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> when he travels, that two Officers of his Horſe Guard, of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Laos,</hi> do march on both ſides, but about 50 or 60 paces from him. His Courtizans appear firſt at the Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, or they do ſometimes follow on Foot with their hands joyn'd on their Breaſt. Sometimes they follow on Horſeback, ſometimes on Elephants, but in this caſe their Elephants have no Chairs. The Foot and Horſe-Guards do likewiſe follow, but confuſedly and without any order; and if this Prince ſtops, all that follow him on Foot, proſtrate themſelves on their Knees and Elbows; and thoſe that follow on Horſeback, or on Elephants, do entirely bow down themſelves on theſe Animals. Thoſe which are named <hi>Schaou-mou,</hi> do alſo follow a Foot: They are the King's Domeſticks, which are not Slaves.

                        <note place="margin">The way of catching a wild Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note>THE place, where the Elephant is that they would take, is as it were a very broad and very long Trench: I ſay, as it were a Trench, becauſe it is not made by digging, but by raiſing the Earth almoſt perpendicular on each ſide, and it is upon theſe Terraſſes that the Spectators ſtand. In the bottom, which is between theſe Terraſſes, is a double row of Trunks of Trees above ten Foot high, planted in the Earth, big enough to reſiſt the Attacks of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and far enough from one another to let a Man paſs between, but too cloſe to let an Elephant paſs through. 'Tis between theſe two rows of Trunks, that the tame Female Elephants, which they had led into the Woods, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed a wild Male Elephant. Thoſe which guide them thither, do cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Leaves, to avoid frighting the Elephants of the Woods, and the Female Elephants have underſtanding enough, to make the Cries proper to call the Males. He was already intrap'd in the double row of Trunks, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Females, and could no more return into the Woods; but the deſign was to take him and tie him, to ſhut him up and tame him. The Egreſs from the ſpace wherein he was, is a ſtrait <hi>Cortina,</hi> compoſed alſo of great Trunks of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98501:32"/>
Trees. So ſoon as the Elephant is enter'd into this Cortine, the Gate through which he enters, and which he opens by thruſting it before him with his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſcis,</hi> ſhuts again with its own weight: the other Gate through which he muſt paſs is ſhut; and beſides the ſpace is ſo narrow, that he cannot turn himſelf therein. The difficulty was to engage the wild Elephant in this Cortine, and to engage him ſingle; for the Females were ſtill with him in the Trench, and he did not ſeparate from them. Several <hi>Siameſes</hi> who ſtood behind the Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado's of the Trunks, and the Foot of the Terraſſes, where the Elephant could not come at them, enter'd every where between the Trunks into the ſpace, where the Elephant was, to vex him; and when the Elephant purſued one of them, he fled very ſwiftly behind the Palliſado's, between which the enraged Elephant vainly thruſt his <hi>Proboſcis,</hi> and againſt which he broke the end of one of his Teeth. Whilſt he thus purſued after thoſe which provoked him, others laid long Nooſes for him. One of the ends of which they kept; and they threw them at him with ſo much dexterity, that the Elephant in running never fail'd to put one of his hind-feet therein: ſo that by diligently putting the end of the Nooſe, they clos'd and faſten'd it a little above the Elephant's foot, Theſe Nooſes were of great Ropes, one of the ends of which was put into the other like a Slip-knot, and the Elephant dragged three or four of them at each hind-foot. For as ſoon as the Nooſe is once knit, he lets go the end thereof, to avoid being drag'd himſelf by the Elephant. The more he is exaſperated, the leſs he aſſociates with the Females; and yet to make them quit this ſpace, a Man mounted on another Female enter'd therein, and went back again ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times through the Cortine, and this Female which he mounted, called the others, by a dry blow, which ſhe ſtruck againſt the ground with her <hi>Proboſcis.</hi> She darted it perpendicularly downwards, yet avoiding to ſtrike altogether with the end, which ſhe kept bended upwards. And when ſhe had repeated this Call twice or thrice, he that rid her, made her to return back again through the Cortine. In fine, after he had perform'd this Trick five or ſix times with this Female, the other Female follow'd her, and ſoon after the Elephant return'd to himſelf, becauſe they forbore to vex him, reſolv'd to go after them. He puſh'd open the firſt door of the Cortine with his <hi>Proboſcis,</hi> and ſo ſoon as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, they threw ſeveral Buckets of water on his Body to refreſh him, and with an incredible ſwiftneſs and dexterity they ty'd him to the Trunks of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine with the Nooſes, which were already at his feet. Then they made a tame Elephant to enter backwards into the Cortine, to whoſe Neck they alſo ty'd the ſavage Elephant by the Neck, and at the ſame time unloos'd him from the Trunks; and two other tame Elephants being likewiſe led to the Succor, all the three, the one on one ſide, the other on the other, and the third behind, do conduct the wild Elephant under a Pent-houſe near adjoining, where they faſten and tie him cloſe by the Neck to a Pivot planted upright, which he made to turn as he turn'd round. They ſaid that he need remain at this Pivot but 24 hours, and that in this ſpace of time they would lead ſome tame Elephants to him to keep him company, and comfort him: that after 24 hours they would carry him into the Stable appointed for him; and that in eight days he would bethink himſelf, and ſubmit to Slavery.</p>
                     <p>They ſpeak of an Elephant as of a Man;<note place="margin">What the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> do think of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> they believe him perfectly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and they relate ſuch rational things of him, that he only wants Speech. This is one, for Example, to which you may give what Credit you pleaſe. Some have related to us for a known Truth, that a Man having crack'd a <hi>Coco</hi> on the head of an Elephant which he rode, and uſing for this purpoſe the back of that kind of Punch, with which I have ſaid that they guide the Elephants, this Elephant took up a reſolution of revenging himſelf as ſoon as he could. He gather'd up with his <hi>Proboſcis,</hi> as they ſay, one of the Shells of the <hi>Coco,</hi> and kept it ſeveral days, never letting it go but to eat, during which he kept it carefully between his two fore-feet. In fine, he that had affronted him, approaching him to give him food, the Elephant ſeiz'd him, trampled him under his feet, and ſlew him, and for his Juſtification laid the <hi>Coco</hi>-Shell on the dead Body. 'Tis in theſe terms that the Relation was made to us: for the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do think that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98501:33"/>
Elephants are capable of Juſtice, and of profiting by the puniſhments one of another; and they alledge that in War, for Inſtance, when theſe Animals muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is needful only to kill one on the ſpot, to render all the others wiſe. But theſe Relations, and ſeveral others, which I have forgot, do ſeem very fabulous; and not to digreſs from the Example, which I have mentioned, it is, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, very evident, that if the offended Elephant had conſulted reaſon, he would not have waited another opportunity of revenge, but would have wreak'd his vengeance on the ſpot; ſeeing that every Elephant can with his <hi>Proboſcis</hi> throw off the Rider, and having thrown him on the ground, trample him under foot, and kill him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> took leave of the three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſent into <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note>As for my ſelf, during the time I was at <hi>Siam,</hi> I ſaw no marvellous Act per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by any of theſe Animals, tho' I am perſuaded that they are more docible than others. They embarked three young ones, which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſent to the three Princes the Grandſons of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Siameſes</hi> which brought them on Board our Ships to embark them, took leave of them, as they would have done of three of their Companions, and whiſper'd them in their Ears, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Go; depart chearfully, you will be Slaves indeed, but you will be ſo to three the greatest Princes of the World, whoſe Service is as moderate at it is glorious.</hi> They afterwards hoiſted them into the Ships, and becauſe they bow'd down themſelves to go under the Decks, they cry'd out with admiration, as if all Animals did not as much to paſs under low places.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Elephant is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous when he is enraged.</note>One day at <hi>Louvo</hi> an Elephant tore in pieces in the Street the Brother of a young <hi>Mandarin,</hi> who was with the King's Ambaſſadors, as Mr. <hi>Torph</hi> had been with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam.</hi> They ſaid indeed that the Elephant was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but this Rage was not of a Beaſt more reaſonable, but only more cruel than the reſt. Thus to render the Elephants of War more tame, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with Females, when they are led out to water and waſh themſelves, and I know not whether without this Train it could ever be accompliſh'd. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> report, that the Elephants are ſenſible of Grandeur; that they love to have a great Houſe, that is to ſay, ſeveral Grooms for their ſervice, and ſome Females for their Miſtreſſes, (with whom nevertheleſs it is ſaid that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants deſire familiarity only in the Woods, ſo long as they are ſavage, and at full liberty:) that without this ſtate, they afflict themſelves at the little regard had for them; and that when they commit any great Fault, the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be inflicted on them, is to retrench their Houſe, to take away their Females, to remove them from the Palace, and to ſend them into Stables abroad. They ſay that an Elephant having been puniſh'd after this manner, and being ſet at liberty, returns to his Lodge at the Palace, and kills the Elephant which was put in his place; which ſeems neither incredible nor ſtrange, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the way be free and open: for every Animal loves his uſual Lodging, and according as he is more or leſs Couragious, he will uſe more or leſs Violence to drive out another Animal.</p>

The Elephants could hardly croſs their Trunks in the Fight, two Men were mounted on each of them to animate them; but after five or ſix Attacks the Combat ended, and they brought in the Females, who parted them. At the great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Palace, the Elephants are permitted to approach nearer, and theſe Animals endeavor to beat off each other's Rider, and frequently they knock him down and kill him.

But as it almoſt always coſt the life of one of the Cocks, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> prohibited theſe ſort of Duels; becauſe the <hi>Talapoins</hi> cry'd, and ſaid, <hi>That the Owners of the Cocks would

for their puniſhment be baſtinado'd in the other World with Bars of Iron.</hi> I forbore going to a Fight of an Elephant and a Tyger, becauſe the King of <hi>Siam</hi> would not be there, and that I knew they would not permit to theſe Animals the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of uſing all their Courage. Some inform'd me that the Tyger had been very Cowardly, and that the Show had ſucceeded ill. The hunting of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants perform'd by an encloſure of Fires in the Woods, has been deſcribed by others: the King of <hi>Siam</hi> went not to that which was perform'd whil'ſt the King's Ambaſſadors were at his Court, neither were they invited; but the other Diverſions which were exhibited to them all at once, and in a vaſt Court, were theſe.</p>
                     <p>The one was a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Comedy,<note place="margin">A <hi>Chineſe</hi> Comedy.</note> which I would willingly have ſeen to the end, but it was adjourned, after ſome Scenes, to go to Dinner. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Comedians, whom the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do love without underſtanding them, do ſpeak in the Throat. All their words are Monoſyllables, and I heard them not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce one ſingle one, but with a new breath: ſome would ſay that it throttles them. Their Habit was ſuch as the Relations of <hi>China</hi> deſcribe it, almoſt like that of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> being claſp'd on the ſide by three or four Buckles, which reach from the Arm-pit to the Hip, with great ſquare Placards before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, whereon were painted Dragons, and with a Girdle three Fingers broad; on which, at equal diſtances, were little ſquares, and ſmall rounds either of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe-Shell or Horn, or of ſome ſort of Wood: And theſe Girdles being looſe, they were run into a Buckle on each ſide to ſuſtain them. One of the Actors who repreſented a Magiſtrate, walk'd ſo gravely, that he firſt trod upon his Heel, and then ſucceſſively and ſlowly upon the Sole and Toes; and as he reſted on the Sole, he rais'd the Heel; and when he reſted on his Toes, the Sole touch'd the ground no more. On the contrary, another Actor, walking like a Madman, threw his Feet and Arms in ſeveral extravagant Poſtures, and after a threatning manner, but much more exceſſive, than the whole Action of our Captains or Matamores. He was the General of an Army; and if the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>China</hi> are true, this Actor naturally repreſented the Affectations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Soldiers of his Country. The Theater had a Cloth on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and nothing on the ſides, like the Stages of our Rope-dancers and Jack-puddings.</p>

Aelian</hi> reports, that <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Rope-dancers at his Wedding, and that they were eſteem'd more nimble than thoſe of other Nations. Theſe are their Actions, which it is neceſſary to confeſs I did not cloſely and carefully conſider, becauſe I was more attentive to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Comedy, than to all the other Shows, which were at the ſame time exhibited to us. They plant a <hi>Bambou</hi> in the ground, and to the end of this they join another, and to the end of this ſecond a third, and to the end of the third a Hoop: ſo that this makes as it were the wood of a round Racket, the Handle of which would be very long. A Man holding the two ſides of the Hoop with his two Hands, puts his Head upon the inferior and inward part of the Hoop, raiſes his Body and his Feet on high, and continues in this poſture an hour, and ſometimes an hour and half: then he will put a Foot where he had plac'd his Head, and without ſtanding otherwiſe, and without fixing the other Foot, he will dance after their manner, that is to ſay, without raiſing himſelf, but only by making Contorſions: And what renders all this more perilous and difficult, is the continual wavering of the <hi>Bambou.</hi> A <hi>Bambou</hi> dancer of this ſort, they call <hi>Lot Bouang; Lot</hi> ſignifies to <hi>paſs,</hi> and <hi>Bouang</hi> a <hi>Hoop.</hi>

the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> that this Prince had made him a great Lord: he had lodged him in the Palace, and had given him a great Title; or, as they ſay, a great Name. Others do walk and dance, after the mode of the Country, without raiſing themſelves; but with Contorſions on a Copper-wire as big as the little Finger, and ſtretch'd after the ſame manner as our Rope-dancers do ſtretch their Rope: And they ſay, that the more the Wire is ſtretched, the more difficult it is to ſtand, by reaſon it gives a greater ſpring, and is ſo much the more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But what they account moſt difficult, is to get upon this Wire by the part of that ſame Wire which is faſten'd to the ground, and to deſcend thence by one of the <hi>Bambou's,</hi> which are plac'd like a <hi>St. Andrew</hi>'s <hi>Croſs</hi> to ſupport it: as alſo to ſit on the Wire croſs-leg'd, to hold there one of thoſe Bands, which ſerves them as a Table to eat on it, and to raiſe themſelves on their Feet. They ceaſe not likewiſe to aſcend and dance upon an extended Rope, but without a Counterpoiſe, and with <hi>Babouches</hi> or Slippers on their Feet, and with <hi>Sabres,</hi> and Buckets of water faſten'd to their Legs. There are ſuch who plant a very high Ladder in the ground, the two ſides of which are of <hi>Bambou's,</hi> and the ſteps of <hi>Sabres,</hi> the edges of which are turned upwards. He goes to the top of this Ladder, and ſtands, and dances without any ſupport on the edge of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> which makes the laſt ſtep thereof; whilſt the Ladder has more motion than a Tree ſhaken by the wind: then he deſcends Head foremoſt, and paſſes nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, winding between all the <hi>Sabres.</hi> I ſaw him deſcend, but obſerved not when he was on the higheſt <hi>Sabre;</hi> and I went not to examine whether the Steps were <hi>Sabres:</hi> not reckoning that the <hi>Sabres</hi> could be keen, except perhaps the loweſt, becauſe they are moſt expos'd to view.

When the Waters begin to retreat, the People returns them Thanks for ſeveral Nights together with a great Illumination; not only for that they are retired, but for the Fertility which they render to the Lands. The whole River is then ſeen cover'd with floating Lanthorns, which paſs with it. There are of different Sizes, according to the Devotion of every particular Perſon; the variouſly painted Paper, whereof they are made, augments the agreeable effect of ſo many Lights. Moreover, to thank the Earth for the Harveſt, they do on the firſt days of their Year make another magnificent Illumination. The firſt time we arriv'd at <hi>Louvo</hi> was in the Night, and at the time of this Illumination; and we ſaw the Walls of the City adorned with lighted Lanthorns at equal diſtances; but the inſide of the Palace was much more pleaſant to behold. In the Walls which do make the Incloſures of the Courts, there were contrived three rows of ſmall Niches all round, in every of which burnt a Lamp. The Windows and Doors were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all adorn'd with ſeveral Fires, and ſeveral great and ſmall Lanthorns, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Figures, garniſhed with Paper, or Canvas, and differently painted, were hung up with an agreeable Symmetry on the Branches of Trees, or on Poſts.</p>

                        </note> That which they call <hi>Cone</hi> is a Figure-dance, to the Sound of the Violin, and ſome other Inſtruments. The Dancers are maſqued and armed, and repreſent rather a Combat than a Dance: And tho' every one runs into high Motions, and extravagant Poſtures, they ceaſſe not continually to intermix ſome word. Moſt of their Masks are hideous, and repreſent either monſtrous Beaſts, or kinds of Devils. The Show which they call <hi>Lacone,</hi> is a Poem intermixt with Epic and Dramatic, which laſts three days, from eight in the Morning till ſeven at Night. They are Hiſtories in Verſe, ſerious, and ſung by ſeveral Actors always preſent, and which do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſing reciprocally. One of them ſings the Hiſtorian's part, and the reſt thoſe of the Perſonages which the Hiſtory makes to ſpeak; but they are all Men that ſing, and no Women. The <hi>Rabam</hi> is a double Dance of Men and Women, which is not Martial, but Gallant; and they preſented unto us the Diverſion thereof with the others, which I have before mentioned. Theſe Dancers, both Men and Women, have all falſe Nails, and very long ones, of Copper: They ſing ſome words in their dancing, and they can perform it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much tyring themſelves, becauſe their way of dancing is a ſimple march round, very ſlow, and without any high motion; but with a great many ſlow Contorſions of the Body and Arms, ſo they hold not one another. Mean while two Men entertain the Spectators with ſeveral Fooleries, which the one utters in the name of all the Men-dancers, and the other in the name of all the Women-dancers. All theſe Actors have nothing ſingular in their Habits: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that dance in the <hi>Rabam,</hi> and <hi>Cone,</hi> have gilded Paper-Bonnets, high and pointed, like the <hi>Mandarins</hi> Caps of Ceremony, but which hang down at the ſides below their Ears, and which are adorned with counterfeit Stones, and with two Pendants of gilded wood. The <hi>Cone</hi> and the <hi>Rabam</hi> are always call'd at Funerals, and ſometimes on other occaſions; and 'tis probable that theſe Shows contain nothing Religious, ſince the <hi>Talapoins</hi> are prohibited to be preſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. The <hi>Lacone</hi> ſerves principally to ſolemnize the Feaſt of the Dedication of a new Temple, when a new Statue of their <hi>Sommona-Codam</hi> is plac'd therein.</p>
                     <p>This Feſtival is likewiſe accompany'd with races of Oxen,<note place="margin">Wreſtling and Boxing.</note> and ſeveral other Diverſions, as of Wreſtlers, and Men that fight with their Elbow and Fiſt. In Boxing, they guard their Hand with three or four rounds of Cord inſtead of the Copper Rings, which thoſe of <hi>Laos</hi> do uſe in ſuch Combats.</p>
                     <p>The Running of Oxen is perform'd in this manner.<note place="margin">A Race of Oxen.</note> They mark out a Plat of 500 Fathom in length, and two in breadth, with four Trunks, which are planted at the four Corners, to ſerve as Boundaries; and it is round theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits that the Coutſe is run. In the middle of this place they erect a Scaffold for the Judges: and the more preciſely to mark out the middle, which is the place from whence the Oxen were to ſtart, they do plant a very high Poſt againſt the Scaffold. Sometimes 'tis only a ſingle Ox which runs againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one and the other being guided by two Men running a foot, which do hold the Reins, or rather the String put into their Noſes, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide; and other Men are poſted at certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to eaſe thoſe which run. But moſt frequently it is a Yoke of Oxen faſten'd to a Plough, which runs againſt another Yoke of Oxen joined to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plough; ſome Men guide them on the right ſide and on the left, as when it is only a ſingle Ox which runs againſt another: But beſides this, it is neceſſary that each Plough be ſo well ſuſtained in the Air by a Man running, that it never touch the ground, for fear it retard the Animals that draw it; and theſe Men which thus ſupport the Ploughs, are more frequently reliev'd than the others.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98501:35"/>
Now tho' the Ploughs run both after the ſame manner, turning always to the right round the ſpace which I have deſcribed, they ſet not out from the ſame place. The one ſtarts at one ſide of the Scaffold, and the other at the other, to run reciprocally one after the other. Thus at the beginning of their Courſe they look from oppoſite places, and they are diſtant one from the other half a Circle, or half the ſpace over which they were to run. Yet they run after the ſame manner, as I have ſaid, turning ſeveral times round the four Boundaries, which I have mentioned, till the one overtakes the other. The Spectators are nevertheleſs all round, yet is it not neceſſary to have Bars to hinder from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too near. Theſe Courſes are ſometimes the ſubjects of Bettings, and the Lords do breed and train up ſmall, but well-proportion'd Oxen for this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and inſtead of Oxen, they do likewiſe make uſe of <hi>Buffalo's.</hi>

They chuſe two <hi>Balons</hi> the moſt equal in all things as is poſſible, and they divide themſelves into two Parties to bett. Then the Captains do beat a precipitate meaſure, not only by knocking with the end of a long Bambou which they have in their hands, but by their Cryes, and the Agitation of their whole Body. The Crew of Rowers excites itſelf alſo by ſeveral redoubled Acclamations, and the Spectator which betts, hollows alſo, and is in no leſs motion than if he really rowed. Oftentimes they commit not to the Captains the care of animating the Rowers, but two of the Bettors do execute this Office themſelves.</p>

                        </note>Such are the Diverſions of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> to which may be added the Domeſtic. They love their Wives and Children exceedingly, and it appears that they are greatly beloved by them. Whilſt the Men acquit themſelves of the ſix months work, which they every one yearly owe to the Prince, it belongs to their Wife, their Mother, or their Children to maintain them. And when they have ſatisfy'd the Service of their King, and they are return'd home, the generality know not unto what buſineſs to apply themſelves, being little accuſtomed to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Profeſſion; by reaſon the Prince employs them indifferently to all, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. Hence it may be judged how lazy the ordinary life of a <hi>Siameſe</hi> is. He works not at all, when he works not for his King: he walks not abroad; he hunts not: he does nothing almoſt but continue ſitting or lying, eating, playing, ſmoking and ſleeping. His Wife will wake him at 7 a clock in the morning, and will ſerve him with Rice and Fiſh: He will fall aſleep again hereupon; and at Noon he will eat again, and will ſup at the end of the day. Between theſe two laſt Meals will be his day; Converſation or Play will ſpend all the reſt. The Women plough the Land, they ſell and buy in the Cities.

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Concerning the Marriage and Divorce of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>'TIs not the Cuſtom in this Country to permit unto Maids the Converſation of young men. The Mothers chaſtiſe them, when they ſurprize them ſo:<note place="margin">The care they have of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Daughters.</note>
but the Girls forbear not to get out, when they can; and this is not impoſſible towards the Evening.</p>
                     <p>They are capable of having children at twelve years of Age,<note place="margin">At what Age they marry them.</note> and ſometimes ſooner; and the greateſt part have none paſt forty. The Cuſtom is therefore to marry them very young, and the Boys in proportion. Yet there is found ſome <hi>Siameſes.</hi> who diſdain Marriage all their life, but there is not any that can turn <hi>Talapoineſſe,</hi> that is to ſay, conſecrate her ſelf to a Religious life, who is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in years.</p>
                     <p>When a Marriage is deſign'd,<note place="margin">How a <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe</hi> ſeeks a Maid in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and how their Marriage is concluded.</note> the Parents of the young man demand the Maid of her Parents, by women advanced in years and of good Reputation. If the Parents of the Maid have any inclination thereunto, they return a favourable Anſwer. Nevertheleſs they reſerve unto themſelves the liberty of conſulting firſt the mind of their Daughter; and at the ſame time they take the hour of the young mans Nativity, and give that of the Birth of the Maid: and both ſides go to the Southſayers to know principally whether the Party propoſed is rich, and whether the Marriage will continue till death without a divorce. As every one carefully conceals his riches, to ſecure them from the oppreſſion of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and the Covetuouſneſs of the Prince, it is neceſſaty that they go to the Southſayer, to know whether a Family is rich, and it is upon the advice of the Southſayers that they take their Reſolution. If the Marriage muſt be concluded, the young man goes to viſit the Lady three times, and carries her ſome preſents of <hi>Betel</hi> and Fruit, and nothing more precious. At the third Viſit the Relations on both ſides appear there likewiſe, and they count the Portion of the Bride, and what is given to the Bridegroom to whom the whole is delivered upon the ſpot, and in preſence of the Relations, but without any writing. The new married couple do alſo commonly receive on this occaſion ſome preſents from their Uncles: and from that time, and without any Religious Ceremony, the Bridegroom has a right to conſummate the Marriage. The <hi>Talapoins</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be preſent thereat. Only ſome days after they go to the houſe of the New Married folks to ſprinkle ſome Holy-water, and to repeat ſome Prayers in the <hi>Baly</hi>-Tongue.</p>
                     <p>The Wedding as in all other places, is attended with Feaſts and ſhows.<note place="margin">The Nuptial Feaſt.</note> They do hire and invite profeſt Dancers thereunto; but neither the Bridegroom, nor the Bride, nor any of the Gueſts do dance. The Feaſt is made at the houſe of the Brides Relations, where the Bridegroom takes care to build an Hall on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which ſtands alone: And from thence the new married perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into another ſingle Building, built alſo on purpoſe, at the expence and care of the Bridegroom, in the Incloſure of <hi>Bambou,</hi> which makes the Incloſure of the Houſe of the Brides Relations. The new married perſons continue there ſome Months, and then go to ſettle where it pleaſes them beſt to build an Houſe for themſelves. A ſingular Ornament for the Daughters of the <hi>Mandarins</hi> which are married, is to put on their head that Circle of Gold, which the <hi>Mandarins</hi> put on their Bonnet of Ceremony. Next to this the decking conſiſts in having finer Pagnes then ordinary, more excellent Pendants, and more curious Rings on their Fingers, and in greater quantity. Some there are who report that the pretended father-in-Law, before the concluſion of the Marriage of his Daughter with his Son-in-Law, keeps him ſix Months in his houſe, to know him better. Some abſolutely deny that this is true. And all that, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, may have given occaſion to the report, is that it belongs to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to build the Wedding Room, and Houſe, which he is to have at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law's,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98501:36"/>
during which, that is to ſay for two or three days at moſt, his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Spouſe brings him Food, without dreading the Conſequences thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Marriage is already concluded, altho' the Feaſt be deferred.</p>

And as to the degrees of Alliance, a Man may marry two Siſters one after the other, and not at the ſame time. Nevertheleſs the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> do diſpenſe with theſe Rules, and do think it hardly poſſible to find a Wife worthy of them, but in perſons that are nearly related to them. The preſent King married his Siſter, and by this Marriage was born the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his only Daughter, whom it is ſaid he has married. I could not find out the truth, but this is the common Report: And I think it probable, in that her Houſe is erected as unto a Queen; and the <hi>Europeans</hi> who have call'd her the Princeſs-Queen, have made the ſame judgment thereof with me. The Relations inform us, that in other places as well as at <hi>Siam,</hi> there are ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of theſe Marriages of the Brother with the Siſter; and it is certain that they have been anciently frequent amongſt a great many <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations, at leaſt in the Royal Families: either to the end that the Daughter might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown with the Son, or out of the fear I have mention'd, that theſe Kings have had of miſplacing their Alliances,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> had married his Siſter.</note> if they married not their own Siſters. For as to what others add, that it is to the end that the People may not doubt of having a Soveraign of the Royal Blood, at leaſt by his Mother, I find no probability therein as to the Eaſt, where the People are ſo little wedded to the Blood of their Kings, and where the Kings do think to aſſure themſelves of the Fidelity of their Wives, by keeping them very cloſely.</p>

If they have Lands, they have not much, by reaſon they cannot obtain the full Property thereof: It belongs always to their King, who at his pleaſure takes away the Lands which he has ſold to particular perſons, and who frequently takes them again without returning the value. Nevertheleſs the Law of the Country is, that Lands ſhould be hereditary in Families, and that particular perſons may ſell them one to another: But this Prince has regard only to this Law, as far as it ſuits him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot prejudice his Demeſnes, which generally extend over all that his Subjects poſſeſs.

Sometimes the <hi>Indian</hi> Lords do at their death give part of their Eſtate to the King their Maſter, to ſecure the reſt to their Family, and this generally ſucceeds.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A Divorce.</note> as may be judged by the Fidelity of the Wives in nouriſhing their Husband, whilſt he ſerves the King: A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which by a kind of Oppreſſion laſts not only ſix Months in a Year, but ſometimes one, two, and three Years together. But when the Husband and Wife cannot ſupport one another, they have the remedy of Divorce. 'Tis true that it is in practice only amongſt the Populace; the Rich who have ſeveral Wives, do equally keep thoſe they love not, and thoſe they love.</p>
                     <p>The Husband is naturally the Maſter of the Divorce,<note place="margin">What are the Laws thereof.</note> but he never refuſeth it to his Wife, when ſhe abſolutely deſires it. He reſtores her Portion to her, and their Children are divided amongſt them in this manner. The Mother has the firſt, the third, the fifth, and ſo all the odd ones. The Father has the ſecond, fourth, ſixth, and all the even ones. Hence it happens, that if there is no more than one Child, it is for the Mother; and that if the number of Children is unequal, the Mother has one more: whether that they judge the Mother would take more care thereof, than the Father; or that having born them in her womb, or nouriſhed them with her milk, ſhe ſeems to have a greater Right therein, than the Father; or that being weaker, ſhe has more need of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor of her Children than he.</p>

They rely on what the Wife ſays thereof; a great ſign of the little Jealouſie of this People. But tho' the Divorce be permitted them, yet they conſider it as a very great Evil, and as the almoſt certain Ruine of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are ordinarily very ill treated in the ſecond Marriages of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. So that this is one of the Cauſes aſſigned why the Country is not popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; altho' the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are fruitful, and do very frequently bring Twins.</p>
                     <p>The power of the Husband is deſpotical in his Family,<note place="margin">Of the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power.</note> even to the ſelling his Children and Wives, his principal Wife excepted, whom he can only repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. The Widows inherit the power of their Husbands, with this reſtriction, that they cannot ſell the Children which they have of the even number, if the Father's Relations oppoſe it; for the Children dare not. After the Divorce, the Father and Mother may each ſell the Children which fell to them by lot, according to the Diviſion I have mentioned. But the Parents cannot kill their Children, nor the Husband his Wives, by reaſon that in general all Murder is prohibited at <hi>Siam.</hi>

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Parents do carefully watch their Daughters, as I have ſaid; and Children are no where permitted to diſpoſe of themſelves to the prejudice of the paternal Power, which is the moſt natural of all Laws.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The love of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Children for their Parents.</note>THE <hi>Siameſe</hi> Children have docility and ſweetneſs, provided they be not diſcountenanc'd. Their Parents know how to make themſelves extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved and reſpected, and to inſpire an extream Civility in them. Their Inſtructions are marvellouſly aſſiſted by the Deſpotic Power, which I have ſaid they have in their Family; but the Parents do alſo anſwer unto the Prince for the Faults of their Children. They ſhare in their Chaſtiſements, and more eſpecially are obliged to deliver them up when they have offended. And tho' the Son be fled, he never fails to return and ſurrender himſelf, when the Prince apprehends his Father, or his Mother, or his other collateral Relations, but older than himſelf, and to whom he owes Reſpect: And this is a great proof of the love of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Children to their Parents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Civility neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                        </note>As to Civility, it is ſo great throughout the Eaſt, even amongſt Strangers, that an <hi>European</hi> who has liv'd there a long time, finds much difficulty to re-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom himſelf to the Familiarities of theſe Countries. The <hi>Indian</hi> Princes being very much given to Traffic, they love to invite Strangers amongſt them, and they protect them even againſt their own Subjects. And hence it is that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do for Example appear ſavage, and that they eſchew the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Strangers. They know that they are thought always to be in the wrong, and that they are always puniſh'd in the Quarrels they have with them. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do therefore educate their Children in an extream Modeſty, by reaſon that it is neceſſary in Trade, and much more in the Service, which for ſix Months in the Year they render unto the King, or to the <hi>Mandarins</hi> by order of their King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note>Silence is not greater amongſt the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> than it is in the Palace of this Prince; the Lords diſpenſe not therewith more than others. The ſole deſire of ſpeaking, never excites the <hi>Siameſes</hi> to ſay any thing that may diſpleaſe. 'Tis neceſſary that they be thoroughly convinced that you would know the truth of any thing, to embolden them to declare it againſt your opinion. They do in nothing affect to appear better inſtructed than you, not in the things of their own Country, altho' you be a Stranger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Raillery amongſt them.</note>They appear'd to me very far from all ſort of Raillery, by reaſon they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not any, perhaps thro' the fault of the Interpreters. 'Tis principally in matter of Raillery, that this ancient Proverb of the <hi>Indians</hi> is verified, <hi>That things best weighed, when delivered by an Interpreter, are as a pure Spring which runs thro' mud.</hi> Moſt ſafe it is to droll little with Strangers, even with thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Language; becauſe that Railleries are the laſt thing that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and that it is eaſie to offend them with a Raillery which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. I doubt not therefore that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> know how to jeſt wittily one with another. Some have aſſur'd me, that they do it frequently amongſt Equals, and even in Verſe; and that as well the Women as the Men are all very readily verſt therein; the moſt ordinary method of which is amongſt them a continued Raillery, wherein emulouſly appears the briskneſs of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and Repartees. I have obſerv'd the ſame thing amongſt the people of <hi>Spain.</hi>

They give, for inſtance, certain Titles to certain Officers, as amongſt us are the Titles of <hi>Excellence</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> Moreover, theſe words <hi>I</hi> and <hi>Me,</hi> indifferent in our Language, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves by ſeveral terms in the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Tongue; the one of which is from the Maſter to the Slave, and the other from the Slave to the Maſter. Another is from the Man of the people to a Lord; and a fourth is us'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98501:37"/>
amongſt Equals; and ſome there are which are only in the mouth of <hi>Talapoins.</hi> The word <hi>You</hi> and <hi>He</hi> are not expreſſed in fewer manners. And when they ſpeak of Women, (becauſe that in their Tongue there is no diſtinction of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into Maſculine and Feminine) they add to the Maſculine the word <hi>Nang,</hi> which in the <hi>Balie</hi> Language ſignifies <hi>Young,</hi> to imply the Feminine, as if we ſhould ſay for Example, <hi>Young Prince,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Princeſs.</hi> It ſeems that their Civility hinders them from thinking that Women can ever grow old.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame Complaiſance they call them by the moſt precious or moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things of Nature, as <hi>young Diamond, young Gold, young Cryſtal, young Flower.</hi>

                     <p>The words which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> uſe by way of Salute, are <hi>cavai Tchaou,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The words which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> uſe in ſaluting.</note> 
                        <hi>I ſalute Lord.</hi> And, if 'tis really a Lord that ſalutes an Inferior, he will bluntly anſwer, <hi>Raou vai, I ſalute,</hi> or <hi>ca vai,</hi> which ſignifies the ſame thing; altho' the word <hi>ca,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>me,</hi> ought to be naturally only in the mouth of a Slave ſpeaking to his Maſter; and that the word <hi>Raou,</hi> which alſo ſignifies <hi>me,</hi> denotes ſome dignity in him that ſpeaks. To ask, <hi>How do you?</hi> they ſay, <hi>Tgiou de? Kindi?</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Do you continue well? Do you eat well?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is a ſingular Obſervation,<note place="margin">How they are permitted to ask News of their King's health.</note> that it is not permitted a <hi>Siameſe</hi> to ask his Inferior any News concerning their King's health; as if it was a Crime in him, that approaches near the perſon of the Prince, to be leſs informed thereof, than another that is obliged to keep at a greater diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Their civil poſture of Sitting is as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſit, croſſing their Legs;<note place="margin">How they ſit.</note> and they are ſo well accuſtom'd thereunto, that, even on a Seat when given them, they place themſelves no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>When they bow, they do not ſtand; but if they ſit not croſs-leg'd,<note place="margin">Their Poſtures</note> they bow themſelves out of reſpect to one another. The Slaves and the Servants before their Maſters, and the common People before the Lords keep on their knees, with their Body ſeated on their heels, their head a little inclin'd, and their hands joined at the top of their forehead. A <hi>Siameſe</hi> which paſſeth by another, to whom he would render Reſpect, will paſs by ſtooping with joined hands more or leſs elevated, and will ſalute him no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>In their Viſits, if it is a very inferior perſon that makes it,<note place="margin">Their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Viſits.</note> he enters ſtooping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, he proſtrates himſelf, and remains upon his knees, and ſitting upon his heels after the manner that I have deſcribed; but he dares not to ſpeak firſt. He muſt wait till he to whom he pays the Viſit, ſpeaks to him: and thus the <hi>Mandarins</hi> that came to viſit us on the behalf of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> waited always till I ſpake to them firſt. If it is a Viſit amongſt Equals, or if the Superior goes to ſee the Inferior, the Maſter of the Houſe receives him at the Hall-door, and at the end of the Viſit he accompanies him thither, and never any further. Moreover, he walks either upright, or ſtooping, according to the degree of Reſpect which he owes to the Viſitor. He likewiſe obſerves to ſpeak firſt, or laſt, according as he can, or as he ought; but he always offers his place to him whom he receives at his Houſe, and invites him to accept it. He afterwards ſerves him with Fruit and Preſerves, and ſometimes with Rice and Fiſh; and more eſpecially he with his own hand preſents him with <hi>Arek</hi> and <hi>Betel,</hi> and <hi>Tea.</hi> The common People forget not <hi>Arek,</hi> and Perſons of Quality do ſometimes accommodate themſelves therewith. At the end of the Viſit, the Stranger firſt teſtifies that he will go; as amongſt us, and the Maſter of the Houſe conſents thereto with very obliging Expreſſions,<note place="margin">To what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place is the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</note> and he muſt be greatly ſuperior to him that renders him the Viſit, to bid him depart.</p>
                     <p>The higheſt place is ſo far the moſt honourable according to them, that they dared not to go into the firſt Story, even for the ſervice of the Houſe, when the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98501:38"/>
Kings Ambaſſadors were in the lower Hall. In the Houſes, which ſtrangers do build of Brick above one ſtory, they obſerve that the undermoſt part of the Stairs never ſerves for a paſſage, for fear leſt any one ſhould go under the feet of another that aſcends: but the <hi>Siameſes</hi> build no more than one ſtory, by reaſon that the bottom would be uſeleſs to them, no perſon amongſt them being willing either to go or lodge under the feet of another. For this reaſon, though the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Houſes be erected on Piles, they never make uſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part, not ſo much as in the Kings Houſe, whoſe Palace being uneven, has ſome pieces higher than others, the under part of which might be inhabited. I remember that when the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam</hi> came to an Inn near <hi>Vincennes,</hi> the firſt Ambaſſador being lodged in the firſt ſtory, and the others in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the ſecond Ambaſſador perceiving that he was above the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Letter, which the firſt Ambaſſador had with him, ran haſtily out of his Chamber bewailing his offence, and tearing his hair in deſpair.</p>

                        </note>At <hi>Siam</hi> the right hand is more honourable than the left: the floor of the Chamber oppoſite to the door is more honourable than the ſides; and the ſides more than the wall where the door is, and the wall which is on the right hand of him that ſits on the floor, is more honourable than that which is on his left hand. Thus in the Tribunals, no perſon ſits on the Bench fixed to the wall which is directly oppoſite to the door, ſave the Preſident, who alone has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminative Vote. The Councellors, who only have a Conſultative Vote, are ſeated on other lower Benches along the ſide-walls, and the other Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the wall of the door. After the ſame manner, if any one receives an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant viſit, he places the Viſitor alone on the floor of the Chamber, and ſeats himſelf with his back towards the door, or towards one of the ſides of the Chamber.</p>

And the miſcarriages in theſe ſorts of duties may be puniſhed with the cudgel by him to whom they are committed, or by his orders, and on the ſpot. So that there is not introduced amongſt them thoſe Airs of familiarity, which in diverſions do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract rudeneſs, injuries, blows and quarrels, and ſometimes intemperance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence: they are always reſtrained by reciprocal reſpects.

It has no brim before nor behind, but only at the ſides: and this brim, which terminates in an oval, is ſo little faſtened to the body of the Hat, that it flaps, and renders a man ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, at the leaſt irregular motion which he makes of his head. Thus theſe people have imagined, that the leſs men are at eaſe, the fewer faults they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

Cuſtom renders the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons leſs ſevere to them, than they would be to us: and much more the thoughts that they may enjoy it in their turn: He that is Superior or Inferior to day, changing his condition to morrow, according to the Prudence, or the Caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humor of the Prince. The hereditary diſtinctions which the Birth does

here give to ſo many perſons who are ſometimes without merit, will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear leſs hard to undergo, to him who ſhould not be thereto accuſtomed, or who ſhould not comprehend that the moſt precious recompence of Vertue is that, which one hopes to tranſmit to his poſterity.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtom is therefore at <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>China,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How the great men diſpenſe with theſe in their Inferiors</note> that when the Superior would diſcreetly manage the Inferior, and teſtify a great deal of conſideration for him (as it ſometimes happens in the intrigues of Court) the Superior affects publickly to avoid the meeting the Inferior; to ſpare him the publick ſubmiſſions, with which he could not diſpenſe if they ſhould meet him. Moreover, affability to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Inferiors, Eaſineſs of acceſs, or going before them, do paſs for weakneſs in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> conſtrain not themſelves to belching in converſation,<note place="margin">Certain things incident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us are not ſo amongſt them, and on the contrary.</note> neither turn they aſide their face, or put any thing before their mouth, no more than the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> 'Tis no incivility amongſt them to wipe off the Sweat of their forehead with their Fingers, and then to ſhake them againſt the ground. For this purpoſe we uſe a Handkercheif, and few of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have any: which is the reaſon why they very ſlovenly perform every thing whereunto the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercheif is neceſſary. They dare to ſpit neither on the Mats, nor the Carpets; and becauſe they are in all houſes a little furniſhed, they make uſe of ſpitting-pots which they carry in their hand. In the Kings Palace they neither cough, nor ſpit, nor wipe their Noſe. The <hi>Betel</hi> which they continually chew, and the juice of which they ſwallow at pleaſure, hinders them: Nevertheleſs they cannot take <hi>Betel</hi> in the Prince's preſence, but only continue to chew that which they have already in their Mouth. They refuſe nothing that is offered them, and dare not to ſay, I have enough.</p>
                     <p>As the moſt eminent place is always amongſt them the moſt honourable,<note place="margin">What is the greateſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front among the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                        </note> the head, as the higheſt part of the body, is alſo the moſt reſpected. To touch any perſon on the head or the hair, or to ſtroke ones hand over the head, is to offer him the greateſt of all affronts. To touch his Bonnet, if he leaves it any where, is a great incivility. The mode of this Country amongſt the <hi>Europeans</hi> which dwell there, is never to leave their Hat in a low place, but to give it to a Servant, who carries it higher than his Head, at the end of a Stick, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching it; and this Stick has a foot, to the end that it may ſtand up, if he that carries it, be obliged to leave it.</p>
                     <p>The moſt reſpectful, or to ſay better, the moſt humble poſture,<note place="margin">What poſtures are more or leſs reſpectful.</note> is that in which they do all keep themſelves continually before their King: in which they expreſs to him more reſpect than the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do to theirs. They keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves proſtrate on their knees and elbows, with their hands joyned at the top of their forehead, and their body ſeated on their heels; to the end that they may lean leſs on their elbows, and that it may be poſſible (without aſſiſting themſelves with their hands, but keeping them ſtill joyned to the top of their forehead) to raiſe themſelves on their knees, and fall again upon their elbows, as they do thrice together, as often as they would ſpeak to their King: I have remark'd, that when they are thus proſtrate, they lean their back-part on one ſide or other, as much as poſſibly they can, without diſplacing their knees, as it were to leſſen and undervalue themſelves the more.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame principle, it is not only more honourable, according to them, to be ſeated on a high ſeat, than on a low ſeat; but it is much more honourable to be ſtanding than ſitting. When <hi>Mr. de Chaumont</hi> had his firſt audience, it was neceſſary that the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen which accompany'd him, ſhould enter firſt into the Hall, and ſeat themſelves on their heels, before the King of <hi>Siam</hi> appeared; to the end that this Prince might not ſee them a moment ſtanding. They were prohibited to riſe up to ſalute him, when he appeared. This Prince never ſuffered the Biſhops nor the Jeſuits to appear ſtanding before him in the Audiences. It is not permitted to ſtand in any place of the Palace, unleſs while walking: and if in this laſt Voyage of 1687, at the firſt audience of the Kings Ambaſſadors, the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen had the honour of entring, when the King of <hi>Siam</hi> was already viſible, it was only becauſe the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> were admitted into the

He did one thing, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>des Farges</hi> ſaluted him, which never had any Precedent at <hi>Siam:</hi> for he commanded that all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Court ſhould ſtand in his preſence, as did M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>des Farges,</hi> and the other <hi>French</hi> Officers which accompany'd him.</p>

As often as they take the liberty to anſwer to their King, they always begin again with theſe words, <hi>Pra pouti Tchaou-ca, co rap pra ouncan ſai claou ſai cramom:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>High and Mighty Lord of me thy Slave, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to take thy Royal Word, and put it on my Brain, and on the top of my Head.</hi> And it is from theſe words <hi>Tchaou-ca,</hi> which ſignifie <hi>Lord of me thy Slave,</hi> that amongſt the <hi>French</hi> is ſprung up this way of ſpeaking <hi>faire choca,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Ta vai bang com,</hi> or <hi>to proſtrate himſelf after the</hi> Siameſe <hi>manner.

                        </note>WHen they have educated their Children to ſeven or eight years old, they put them into a Convent of <hi>Talapoins,</hi> and make them aſſume the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a <hi>Talapoin:</hi> for it is a Profeſſion which obliges not, and which is quitted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98501:39"/>
at pleaſure without diſgrace. Theſe little <hi>Talapoins</hi> are called <hi>Nen:</hi> they are not Penſioners, but their Friends do daily ſend them Food. Some of theſe <hi>Nens</hi> are of a good Family, and have one or more Slaves to wait upon them.</p>
                     <p>They are taught principally to Read, to Write, and to caſt Accompt;<note place="margin">What they learn.</note> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that nothing is more neceſſary to Merchants, and that all the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Traffic. They are taught the Principles of their Morality, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> but no Hiſtory, nor Law, nor any Science. They likewiſe teach them the <hi>Balie</hi> Tongue, which, as I have more than once decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is the language of their Religion, and their Laws; and few amongſt them do make any progreſs therein, if they do not a long time adhere to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Talapoin,</hi> or if they enter not into ſome offices: for it is in theſe two Caſes only that this language is uſeful to them.</p>
                     <p>They write the <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi> from the left hand to the right,<note place="margin">The <hi>Balie</hi> and <hi>Siameſe</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Chineſe.</hi>
                        </note> after the ſame manner as we write our Languages of <hi>Europe:</hi> in which they differ from moſt of the other <hi>Aſiatics,</hi> who have ever wrote from the right to the left; and from the <hi>Chineſes</hi> alſo, who draw the line from the top to the bottom; and who in the ranging of the lines in one Page, do put the firſt on the right hand, and the others ſucceſſively towards the left. They are different alſo from the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> in that they have not like them a Character for every word, or even for every ſignification of a ſingle word; to the end that the writing may have no Equivocations like the Language. The <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi> Tongues have, like ours, an Alphabet of few letters, of which are compos'd ſyllables and words. Moreover, the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Language participates greatly of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> in that it has a great deal of Accent, (for their Voice frequently riſes above one fourth) and in that it conſiſts almoſt all of Monoſyllables: ſo that it may be preſumed, that if one perfectly underſtood it, one ſhould find that the few words which it has of ſeveral ſyllables, are either foreign, or compoſed of Monoſyllables, ſome of which are uſed only in theſe Compoſitions.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt remarkable Similitude that is between theſe two Languages,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> Languages have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions of words, the <hi>Balie</hi> has.</note> and which is not found in the <hi>Balie,</hi> is that neither the one nor the other have any Declenſion or Conjugation, nor perhaps Derivations, which the <hi>Balie</hi> has. As for Example, the word which ſignifies <hi>Content,</hi> may likewiſe ſignifie <hi>Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that which ſignifies <hi>Good,</hi> will ſignifie <hi>Well,</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> according to the various ways of uſing them. The placing alone denotes the Caſes in Nouns, and herein their diſpoſition is hardly different from ours. And as to the Conjugations, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have only four or five ſmall Particles, which they put ſometimes before the Verb, and ſometimes after, to ſignifie the Numbers, Tenſes, and Moods thereof. I will inſert them at the end of this Volume, with the <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi> Alphabets; and it is in this that their whole Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar almoſt conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>Their Dictionary is not leſs ſimple: I mean,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſe</hi> Language not copious, but very figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> that their Language is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; but the turn of their Phraſe is only more various, and more difficult. In cold Countries, where the Imagination is cold, every thing is called by its Name; and they do there abound as much or more in words, than in things: And when one has fixed all theſe words in his memory, he may promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſpeak well. It is not the ſame in hot Countries, few words do there ſuffice to expreſs much, by reaſon that the briskneſs of the Imagination employs them in an hundred different ways, all figurative. Take two or three Examples of the methods of ſpeaking <hi>Siameſe. Good Heart</hi> ſignifies <hi>Content,</hi> thus to ſay, <hi>If I was at</hi> Siam, <hi>I ſhould be content;</hi> they ſaid, <hi>If I were City</hi> Siam, <hi>me heart good much. Sii</hi> ſignifies <hi>Light,</hi> and by a Metaphor <hi>Beauty;</hi> and by a ſecond Metaphor, this word <hi>Sii</hi> being joined with <hi>Pak,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Mouth; Sii-pak,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Lips;</hi> as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>The Light, or Beauty of the Mouth.</hi> Thus, <hi>The Glory of the Wood,</hi> ſignifies <hi>a Flower;</hi> the <hi>Son of the Water</hi> implies in general, whatever <hi>is ingender'd in the Water without it be Fiſh;</hi> as Crocodiles, and all ſorts of aquatic Inſects. And on other occaſions, the word <hi>Son</hi> will only denote <hi>Smalneſs,</hi> as <hi>the Sons of the Weights,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>ſmall Weights,</hi> contrary to the word <hi>Mother,</hi> which in certain things they make uſe of to ſignifie <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> In ſhort, I have not ſeen any words in this Language that have reſemblance to

                        <note place="margin">Arithmetic.</note>I proceed to Arithmetic, which after Reading and Writing, is the principal Study of the <hi>Siameſes.</hi> Their Arithmetic, like ours, hath ten Characters, with which they figure the Nought like us, and to which they give the ſame Powers as we, in the ſame diſpoſition, placing, like us, from the Right to the Left, Unites, Tens, Hundreds, Thouſands, and all the other Powers of the Number Ten. The <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants are ſo well vers'd in caſting Accompt, and their Imagination is ſo clear thereupon, that it is ſaid they can preſently reſolve very difficult Queſtions of Arithmetic; but I ſuppoſe likewiſe that they do never reſolve what they cannot reſolve immediately. They love not to trouble their heads, and they have no uſe of <hi>Algebra.</hi>

Martinius,</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>China,</hi> intimates, that they invented about 2600 or 2700 years before Jeſus Chriſt. However it be, <hi>Pignorius,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Servis,</hi> informs us, that this Inſtrument was familiar to the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Slaves that were appointed to caſt Accompt.

The eſſential Character of the People of Countries extreamly hot, or extreamly cold, is ſluggiſhneſs of Mind and Body; with this difference, that it degenerates into Stupidity in Countries too cold, and that in Countries too hot, there is always Spirit and Imagination; but of that ſort of Imagination and Spirit, which ſoon flaggs with the leaſt Application.</p>

                        <note place="margin">They have Imagination and Lazineſs.</note>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do conceive eaſily and clearly, their Repartees are witty and quick, their Objections are rational. They imitate immediately, and from the firſt day they are tolerable good Workmen: ſo that one would think a little Study would render them very accompliſht, either in the higheſt Sciences, or in the moſt difficult Arts; but their invincible Lazineſs ſuddenly deſtroys theſe hopes. It is no wonder therefore if they invent nothing in the Sciences which they love beſt, as Chymiſtry and Aſtronomy.</p>

                        <note place="margin">They are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Poets, and their Poetry is Rhyme.</note>I have already ſaid that they are naturally Poets. Their Poetry, like ours; and that which is now uſed throughout the known World, conſiſts in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Syllables, and in Rhyme. Some do attribute the Invention thereof to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> by reaſon it ſeems to have been they that have carried it every where. The Relations of <hi>China</hi> report, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Poetry at preſent is in Rhyme; but tho' they ſpeak of their ancient Poetry, of which they ſtill have ſeveral Works, they declare not of what nature it was, becauſe, in my opinion,<note place="margin">They read the ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in the preſent Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> it is difficult to judge thereof: for tho' the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have preſerved the ſenſe of their ancient Writing, they have not preſerved their ancient Language. However, I can hardly comprehend from a Language wholly conſiſting of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſyllables, and full of accented Vowels, and compounded Dipthongs, that if the Poetry conſiſts not in Rhyme, it can conſiſt in Quantity, as did the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poems.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their <hi>Genius</hi> in Poetry.</note>I could not get a <hi>Siameſe</hi> Song well tranſlated, ſo different is their way of thinking from ours; yet I have ſeen ſome Pictures, as for Example, of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Garden, where a Lover invites his Miſtreſs to come. I have alſo ſeen ſome Expreſſions, which to me appear'd full of Smootineſs, and groſs Immodeſty; altho' this had not the ſame Effect in their Language. But beſides Love-Songs, they have likewiſe ſome Hiſtorical and Moral Songs altogether: I have heard the <hi>Pagayeurs</hi> ſing ſome, of which they made me to underſtand the ſenſe. The <hi>Lacone</hi> which I have mentioned, is no other than a Moral and Hiſtorical Song; and ſome have told me, that one of the Brothers of the King of <hi>Siam</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſome Moral Poems very highly eſteem'd, to which he himſelf ſet the Tune.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">They are no Orators.</note>But if the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are born Poets, they neither are born, nor do become Orators. Their Books are either Narrations of a plain Style, or ſome Sentences
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98501:40"/>
of a broken Style full of <hi>Idea's.</hi> They have no Advocates: the Parties do each declare their Cauſe to the Regiſter, who, without any Rhetoric, writes down the Facts and Reaſons which are told him. When they preach, they read the <hi>Balie</hi> Text of their Books, and they tranſlate and expound it plainly in <hi>Siameſe,</hi> without any Action, like our Profeſſors, and not our Preachers.</p>
                     <p>They know how to ſpeak to a Buſineſs,<note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame.</note> and do therein manage themſelves with a great deal of Inſinuation; but as for their Compliments, they are all after one Model, which is indeed very good; but which is the reaſon that in the ſame Ceremonies they do always ſpeak almoſt the ſame things. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> himſelf has his words almoſt counted in his Audiences of Ceremony; and he ſpake to the King's Ambaſſadors almoſt the ſame that he had deliver'd to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>de Chaumont,</hi> and before him to the late Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis.</hi>

                     <p>I have not forgot that excellent Speech which the Ambaſſador of <hi>Siam</hi> made to the King at his Audience of Leave,<note place="margin">The laſt Speech which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Siam</hi> made in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> and which alone might cauſe a Belief that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are great Orators; if we could judge of the merit of the Original, by that of the Tranſlation: But this is difficult, eſpecially in two Languages, which have ſo little ſimilitude one to the other. All that we ought to think thereof, is, that the main of the Deſign and Thought is the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Ambaſſador's; and I wonder not that he has admir'd the excellent Meen, the Majeſtic Air, the Power, the Affability, and all the extraordinary qualities of the King. They ought to amaze him more than another, becauſe that theſe Virtues are abſolutely unknown in the Eaſt; and if he had dar'd to declare the Truth, he would have confeſſed that the Flattery natural to thoſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had made him all his life to extol thoſe very things where they were not, and that he ſaw the firſt Example thereof in the King. When the <hi>Mandarins</hi> came on Board our Ship to carry the firſt Compliment of the King of <hi>Siam</hi> to the King's Ambaſſadors, they took Leave of them, by teſtifying unto them that they demanded it unwillingly, and out of an indiſpenſible neceſſity of going to ſatisfie the Impatience of the King their Maſter, about the things which they had to relate unto him: A Thought natural and good, on which runs the whole beginning of the Ambaſſador's Speech of Leave. And as to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent place where he ends, that their Relation of him and his Colleagues would be put into the Archives of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam;</hi> and that the King their Maſter would do him an Honour to ſend him to the Princes his Allies, he was in this a leſs Orator, than Hiſtorian. He render'd an account of a Practice of his Country, which is not omitted in great occaſions, and which is in uſe in other Kingdoms. One Example there is in <hi>Oſorius,</hi> in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he relates how <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King of <hi>Congo,</hi> inſerted into his Argives the Hiſtory of his Converſion, and that of another famous Embaſſy which he had received from <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and how he imparted it to all the Princes his Vaſſals. We may therefore be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are not Orators, and that they never have need to be ſuch. Their Cuſtom is not to make either Speech or Compliment to the Princes to whom they ſend them, but to anſwer the things about which theſe Princes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate them. They made a Speech at this Court, to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our Cuſtoms, and to enjoy an Honour they highly valued; which was, to ſpeak to the King, before his Majeſty ſpake to them. This is all we can ſay of their Poetry, and their Rhetoric.</p>
                     <p>They abſolutely ignore all the parts of Philoſophy,<note place="margin">They have a Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and no Theology.</note> except ſome Principles of Morality, where, as we ſhall ſee in diſcourſing of the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt Truth with Falſhood. I will at the ſame time alſo demonſtrate, that they have not any ſort of Theology, and that we might perhaps juſtifie them about the worſhipping of the falſe Deities whereof they are accuſed, by an Impiety more culpable, which is not to acknowledge any Divinity neither true nor falſe.</p>
                     <p>They ſtudy not the Civil Law:<note place="margin">How they ſtudy their Laws.</note> They learn the Laws of their Country on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Employments. They are not Public, as I have ſaid, for want of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when they enter into any Office, they put into their hands a Copy of the Laws which concern it: And the ſame thing is practiſed in <hi>Spain,</hi> tho' the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98501:41"/>
Laws be there in the hands of all perſons, and that there are publick Schools, to teach them. As for example, in the Proviſions of a <hi>Corregidor</hi> they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the whole Title of the <hi>Corregidors,</hi> which is in the compiling of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Decrees. I have likewiſe ſeen ſome example of this in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery nor Anatomy.</note>Their chief Ignorance is to know nothing in Chyrurgery, and to ſtand in need of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> not only for Trapans, and for all the other difficult Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chyrurgery, but for ſimple Blood-lettings. They are utterly ignorant of Anatomy: and ſo far from having excited their Curioſity, to diſcover either the Circulation of the Blood, or all the new things, that we know touching the ſtructure of the body of Animals, that they open not the dead bodies, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having roaſted them in their Funeral ſolemnities, under pretence of burning them; and they open them only to ſeek wherewith to abuſe the ſuperſtitious credulity of the people. For example, they alledge that they ſometimes find in the Stomach of the dead, great pieces of freſh Pig's fleſh, or of ſome other Animal, about eight or ten pound in weight: and they ſuppoſe that it has been put therein by ſome Divination, and that it is good to perform others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">They have not any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</note>They trouble not themſelves to have any principle of Medicine, but only a number of Receipts, which they have learnt from their Anceſtors, and in which they never alter any thing. They have no regard to the particular ſymptoms of diſeaſes: and yet they fail not to cure a great many; becauſe that the natural Temperance of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> preſerves them from a great many evils difficult to cure. But when at laſt it happens that the Diſtemper is ſtronger than the Remedies, they fail not to attribute the cauſe thereof to Inchantment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Phyſicians are great Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks.</note>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> underſtanding one day that I was ſomewhat indiſpoſed, tho it was ſo little, that I kept not my Chamber, he had the goodneſs to ſend all his Phyſicians to me. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> offer'd ſome Civility to the <hi>Siameſes</hi> and <hi>Peguins:</hi> and then they made me ſit, and ſat down themſelves: and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demanded ſilence, for the company was numerous, they felt my pulſe one after the other a long time, to make me ſuſpect that it was not only a grimace. I had read that at <hi>China</hi> there is no School for Phyſicians, and that one is there admitted to exerciſe the profeſſion thereof, at moſt by a flight examination made by a Magiſtrate of Juſtice, and not by Doctors in Phyſick. And I knew moreover, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are great Cheats, and the <hi>Chineſes</hi> much greater: ſo that I had throughly reſolved to get rid of theſe Doctors without making any experience of their Remedies. After having felt my pulſe, they ſaid that I was a little feveriſh, but diſcerned it not at all: they added that my Stomach was out of order, and I perceived it not, ſave that my voice was a little weak. The next morning the <hi>Chineſes</hi> return'd alone to preſent me a ſmall Potion warm, in a China Cup cover'd and very neat. The ſmell of the remedy pleas'd me, and made me to drink it, and I found my ſelf neither better nor worſe.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98501:41"/>
is between the Mountebanks of <hi>China</hi> and the Quacks of <hi>Europe</hi> on the account of Medicine, is that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do abuſe the ſick by pleaſant and enticing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and that the <hi>Europeans</hi> do give us Drugs, which the humane Body ſeeks to get rid off by all manner of means: ſo that we are inclined to believe that they would not thus torment a ſick perſon, if it was not certainly very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                     <p>When any perſon is ſick at <hi>Siam,</hi>

                        </note> he begins with cauſing his whole body to be moulded by one that is skilful herein, who gets upon the Body of the ſick perſon, and tramples him under his feet. 'Tis likewiſe reported that great bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd women do thus cauſe themſelves to be trodden under foot by a Child, to procure themſelves to be delivered with leſs pain: for in hot Countries, though their Deliveries ſeem to be more eaſie by the natural Conformation of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet they are very painful, by reaſon perhaps that they are preceded with leſs Evacuation.</p>
                     <p>Antiently the <hi>Indians</hi> apply'd no other Remedy to plenitude, than an Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diet; and this is ſtill the principal ſubtilty of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in Medicine. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> do now make uſe of Blood-letting, provided they may have an <hi>European</hi> Chyrurgion: and ſometimes inſtead of Blood-letting they do uſe Cupping-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Scarifications and Leeches.</p>
                     <p>They have ſome Purgatives which we make uſe of, and others which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them; but they know not the <hi>Hellebore,</hi> ſo familiar to the Antient Greek Phyſicians. Moreover they obſerve not any time in purging, and know not what the Criſis is: though they underſtand the benefit of Sweats in diſtempers, and do highly applaud the uſe of Sudorificks.</p>
                     <p>In their Remedies they do uſe Minerals and Simples, and the <hi>Europeans</hi> have made known the <hi>Quinquina</hi> unto them. In general all their Remedies are very hot; and they uſe not any inward Refreſhment: but they bath themſelves in Fevers, and in all ſorts of diſeaſes. It ſeems that whatever concenters or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the natural heat, is beneficial to them.</p>

                     <p>They do not underſtand Chymiſtry, although they paſſionately affect it;<note place="margin">Their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, and their Fables about this matter.</note> and that ſeveral amongſt them do boaſt of poſſeſſing the moſt profound ſecrets thereof. <hi>Siam,</hi> like all the reſt of the Eaſt, is full of two ſorts of perſons upon this account, Impoſtors and Fools. The late King of <hi>Siam,</hi> the Father of the preſent Prince, ſpent two Millions, a great ſumm for his Country, in the vain reſearch of the Philoſophers Stone: and the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> reputed ſo wiſe, have for three or four thouſand years had the folly of ſeeking out an Univerſal Remedy, by which they hope to exempt themſelves from the neceſſity of dying. And as amongſt us there are ſome fooliſh Traditions concerning ſome rare perſons that are reported to have made Gold, or to have lived ſome Ages; there are ſome very ſtrongly eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and the other Orientals, concerning thoſe that know how to render themſelves immortal, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolutely, or in ſuch a manner, that they can die no otherwiſe than of a violent death. Wherefore it is ſuppoſed, that ſome have withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſight of men, either to enjoy a free and peaceable Immortality, or to ſecure themſelves from all foreign force, which might deprive them of their life, which no diſtemper could do. They relate wonders concerning the knowledge of theſe pretended Immortals, and it is no matter of aſtoniſhment that they think themſelves capable of forcing Nature in ſeveral things, ſince they imagine that they have had the Art of freeing themſelves from Death.</p>

They know only ſome Practical part thereof, the Reaſons of which they diſdain to penetrate; but of which they make uſe in the Horoſcopes of particular Perſons, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Almanac, which, as it were, is a general Horoſcope.</p>

                        </note>It appears that they have twice cauſed their Calendar to be reformed by able Aſtronomers, who, to ſupply the Aſtronomical Tables, have taken two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary <hi>Epocha's,</hi> but yet remarkable for ſome rare Conjunction of the Planets. Having once eſtabliſhed certain Numbers upon theſe Obſervations, they by the means of ſeveral Additions, Subſtractions, Multiplications and Diviſions, have given for the following Years the ſecret of finding the place of the Planets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as we find the Epact of every Year, by adding eleven to the Epact of the Year foregoing.</p>
                     <p>

I gave to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caſſini,</hi> Director of the Obſervatory at <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe</hi> Method of finding the place of the Sun and Moon by a Calculation, the ground of which is taken from this <hi>Epocha.</hi> And the ſingular Merit which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caſſini</hi> has had of unfolding a thing ſo difficult, and penetrating the Reaſons thereof, will doubtleſs be admired by all the Learned. Now as this <hi>Epocha</hi> is viſibly the ground only of an Aſtronomical Calculation, and has been choſen rather than another, only becauſe it appear'd more commodious to Calculation than another, it is evident that we muſt thence conclude nothing which reſpects the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Hiſtory; nor imagine that the Year 638, has been more Famous amongſt them than another for any Event, from which they have thought fit to begin to compute their Years, as we compute ours, from the Birth of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World.</p>

certain that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have not any Memoirs of the time in which their <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom</hi> might have lived: And I cannot perſuade my ſelf that their <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom</hi> could be <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was not in the <hi>East,</hi> nor that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Epocha</hi> is other than <hi>Aſtronomical</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> no more than their Modern <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſtill make uſe thereof in their Dates,<note place="margin">The Variety of Style in their Dates.</note> after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh'd it in their Aſtronomical Calculations, it is becauſe that in things of Style they do not eaſily alter the Uſages unto which they are accuſtomed; and yet they ceaſe not to date ſometimes with reſpect to that modern <hi>Epocha</hi> which they have taken, as I have ſaid, from the Year of our Lord 638. But their firſt Month is always the Moon of <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from the ancient Style, even then when they date the Year according to their new <hi>Stile;</hi> tho' the firſt Month of the Year, according to this new Style, be the fifth or ſixth of the old Style.</p>
                     <p>This, in few words, is the whole Skill of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> in Aſtronomy.<note place="margin">What the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> do think of the Syſtem of the World.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they underſtand nothing of the true Syſtem of the World, becauſe they know nothing by Reaſon. They believe therefore, like all the Eaſt, that the Eclipſes are cauſed by ſome Dragon, which devours the Sun and Moon (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by reaſon of the Aſtronomer's metaphorical way of ſpeaking, that the Eclipſes are made in the Head and Tail of the Dragon:) And they make a great noiſe, with Fire-ſhovels and Kettles, to ſcare and drive away this pernicious Animal, and to deliver thoſe beauteous Planets. They believe the Earth Four-ſquare, and of vaſt Extent, on which the Arch of Heaven reſts at its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as if it was one of our Glaſs-Bells with which we cover ſome of our Plants in our Gardens. They aſſert, that the Earth is divided into four habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parts of the World, ſo ſeparated one from the other by Seas, that they are, as it were, <hi>four</hi> different <hi>Worlds.</hi> In the middle of theſe <hi>four Worlds,</hi> they ſuppoſe an exceeding high Pyramidal Mountain with four equal ſides, called, <hi>Caou pra Soumene (Caou</hi> ſignifies, a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and to <hi>Mount;</hi>) and from the Surface of the Earth, or the Sea, to the top of this Mountain, which, as they ſay, touches the Stars, they compute 84000 <hi>Iods,</hi> and every <hi>Iod</hi> contains about 8000 Fathoms. They reckon as many <hi>Iods</hi> from the Surface of the Sea to the Foundations of the Mountain; and they likewiſe reckon 84000 <hi>Iods</hi> extent of Sea from each of the four ſides of this Mountain to every of the four Worlds which I have mentioned. Now our World, which they call <hi>Tchiampion,</hi> lies, as they report, to the South of this Mountain, and the Sun, Moon and Stars do inceſſantly turn round it; and it is that, which according to them, makes the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night.</hi> At the top of this Mountain is a Heaven, which they call <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratiracha,</hi> which is ſurmounted by the Heaven of Angels. This Sample, which is all I know thereof, will ſuffice to demonſtrate their Groſsneſs; and if it does not exactly accord to what others have writ before me concerning this matter, we muſt not more admire the variety of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Opinions in a thing they underſtand not, than the contrariety of our Syſtems in Aſtronomy, which we pretend to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>The extream Superſtition of the <hi>Indians</hi> is therefore a very natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their profound Ignorance; but for their Excuſe, ſome People,<note place="margin">The <hi>Indians</hi> are Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to their extream Ignorance.</note> more illuminated than them, have not been leſs Superſtitious. Have not the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and after them the <hi>Romans,</hi> believed in Judiciary Aſtrology, Augurs, Preſages, and all ſorts of Arts invented under pretence of Divining and Predicting? They thought that it was the goodneſs of the Gods, to beſtow on Men ſome Succors to penetrate Futurities; and the words <hi>Divination</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> are the ſame word in their Origine, becauſe that according to the ancient <hi>Pagans,</hi> the Art of Divining was only an Art to conſult the Deities. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> are alſo of opinion, that there is an Art of Prophecying, as there is one of reſtoring Health to the Sick: And when the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Soothſayers are miſtaken, he cauſes them to be baſtinado'd, not as Impoſtors, but as negligent perſons; as he commands his Phyſicians to be cudgell'd, when the Remedies they give him, perform not the Effect which is thereby promiſed.</p>

A Serpent which croſſes the way, the Thunderbolt which falls on a Houſe, any thing that falls as it were of itſelf, and without any apparent Cauſe, are Subjects of dread to the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of laying aſide or ſetting upon an Affair, how important and preſſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. One of the ways they make uſe of to foretel things to come, and which is common to all the Orientals, is to perform ſome ſuperſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then to go into the City, and to take for an Oracle about what they deſire to know, the firſt words which they hear accidentally ſpoken in the Streets, or in the Houſes. I could learn no more thereof, by reaſon that the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, which I made uſe of, look'd upon theſe things with Horror, as Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Compacts with the <hi>Daemon,</hi> altho' it be very poſſible that they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fooleries full of Credulity and Ignorance.

At this very day ſeveral perſons have a Superſtitious Belief in certain Herbs which they gather the Evening of <hi>St. John,</hi> from whence is riſen this Proverb, To uſe or employ all the Herbs of <hi>St. John,</hi> that is, the utmoſt skill in an Affair: And amongſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> there are ſome, who, after having waſh'd their Feet in Wine on <hi>St. John</hi>'s Eve, do throw the Wine out at Window, and ſo ſtand afterwards to hear thoſe that paſs along the Street, taking for a certain Augury on what they deſire to know, the firſt word they hear ſpoken.</p>

They pretend to have ſome <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or Characters which they call <hi>Cata,</hi> to accompliſh whatever they pleaſe; as to kill, or to render invulnerable; and to impoſe Silence on Perſons and Dogs, when they would commit a wicked Action, and not be diſcovered. If they prepare a Medicine, they will faſten to the brim of the Veſſel ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, wherein they will write ſome myſterious words, to hinder the <hi>Petpayatons</hi> from carrying away the vertue of the Remedy with the ſteem. Theſe <hi>Petpaya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> are in their Opinion ſome Spirits diffuſed in the Air, of whom they believe, amongſt other things, that they do firſt enjoy all the Maidens; and that they do them that pretended hurt, which is renewed every Month.

                        <note place="margin">Superſtitions for Women in Child-bed.</note>The ſuperſtitions which they uſe towards Women in Child-bed, appear not leſs ridiculous, although they be founded perhaps on ſome benefit for health. They believe that Women in Child-bed have need of being purified: whether that the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpread throughout the Earth, have ſowed this Tradition amongſt ſeveral Nations, or that the people of hot Countries are more eaſily prejudiced than thoſe of cold Countries with the natural impurities of Women. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> keep the Women in Child-bed before a continual and great fire for a month, where they turn them ſometimes on one ſide, ſometimes on the other. The ſmoak does greatly incommode them, and paſſes ſlowly through an Aperture, which they make in the roof of their houſes. The <hi>Peguins</hi> do put their Wives on a kind of Bambou-grate, very nigh, with fire underneath; but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98501:43"/>
they keep them thus no more than four or five days. At the up-riſing, the one and the other return thanks to the Fire for having purified their Wives; and in the Entertainment which they give on this occaſion to their Friends, they eat nothing which they have not firſt offered to the Fire, leaving it ſome time near it. During the whole time of lying in Child-bed, the Women neither eat nor drink any thing that is not hot: and I underſtand that our <hi>Midwives.</hi> forbid their Women alſo to drink any thing cold.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt ſpeedy and moſt ſenſible effects of the pretended Divinations of the <hi>Indians</hi> are in the uſe of certain Philtres, which are only natural drinks.<note place="margin">Philtres look'd upon as the effect of Magick.</note>
The <hi>Indies</hi> do produce ſome Simples, the kinds, force, or uſe of which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not. The Amorous <hi>Philtres,</hi> or Love-potions, are thoſe which debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Imagination, and make a Man to become a Child; ſo that after this it is eaſie to govern him. My domeſticks aſſur'd me that they had ſeen a man at <hi>Batavia,</hi> of whom it was reported that his wife had render'd him ſenſeleſs after this manner. Other drinks do cauſe other effects. The Relations are full of thoſe which the women of <hi>Goa</hi> frequently give their Husbands; and which render them ſo ſtupid for 24 hours, that they can then be unfaithful to them in their preſence. <hi>Opium,</hi> or the quinteſſence of Poppies, cauſes ſuch different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that it procures ſleep, or watchfulneſs, as it is variouſly prepared. The <hi>Indians</hi> going to Battel, do take thereof to inſpire them with courage, or rather with fury. They then run headlong upon the Enemy like wild Boars: It is dangerous to attend them, but one may avoid them by turning out of the way, for they go forwards. Moreover, the effect of <hi>Opium</hi> laſts only ſome hours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they relapſe not only into their natural cowardice, but into a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which leaves them but little action for their defence. And ſuch were thoſe <hi>Macaſſers,</hi> which had conſpired againſt the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> ſome months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings Ambaſſadors arrived there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have likewiſe ſome Diſtempers,<note place="margin">Diſtempers conſidered as the Effects of Magick.</note> the ſymptoms of which are ſometimes ſo ſtrange, that they think the cauſe thereof can be attributed only to Witchcraft. But beſides theſe extraordinary caſes, their Phyſicians do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually accuſe the greater Energy of the Spirits, with the inefficaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Remedies; and they do herein play ſuch ſubtile juggling tricks, or rather they deal with perſons ſo credulous, that whilſt we were at <hi>Siam,</hi> they made a ſick man believe, that he had voided a Deers skin with a Medicine, and that he muſt have ſwallowed this Deers skin by a Magical effect, and without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it. This is what I judged neceſſary to relate concerning the <hi>Siameſes</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, of which every one may judge as he pleaſes: for if on the one hand I have ſeen nothing which obliges me to accuſe them of Sorcery, on the other hand I am not concern'd to juſtifie them entirely.</p>
                     <p>But before we quit this ſubject I will here add one thing,<note place="margin">Superſtition or Vanity touching the walls of Cities.</note> which may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed at your pleaſure, to Superſtition or Vanity: One day when the King's Ambaſſadors were ſaluted by the real or ſuppoſed Ambaſſadors, from <hi>Patana, Camboya,</hi> and ſome other neighbouring Courts, the Ambaſſadors of ſome of the ſeveral Nations which are at <hi>Siam,</hi> were alſo at this Viſit: and among the reſt there were two, who ſaid that the City of their Origine, the name of which I have forgot, remained no more: but that it had been ſo conſiderable, that it was impoſſible to go round it in three Months. I ſmil'd thereat as at a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs folly: and in a few days after Mr. <hi>de la Mare</hi> the Ingineer, whom Mr. <hi>de Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> had left at <hi>Siam,</hi> informed me, that when by the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s order he had been at <hi>Ligor</hi> to take the draught thereof, the Governour would not permit him to go round it under two days, though he could have done it in leſs than an hour. Let us proceed to the ſtudy of the laſt part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</p>

They have neither Cadence, nor quaver no more than the <hi>Caſtilians:</hi> but they ſometimes ſing like us without words, which the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> think very ſtrange; and in the ſtead of words, they only ſay <hi>noi, noi,</hi> as we do ſay <hi>lan-la-lari.</hi> I have not remark'd one ſingle Air, whoſe meaſure was triple, whereas thoſe are without compariſon the moſt familiar to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> without ſhewing himſelf, heard ſeveral Airs of our <hi>Opera</hi> on the Violin, and it was told us that he did not think them of a movement grave enough: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have nothing very grave in their Songs; and whatever they play on their Inſtruments, even in their Kings march, is very brisk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">They have not ſeveral parts in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts.</note>They underſtand not more than the <hi>Chineſes</hi> the diverſity of Parts in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; they underſtand not the Variety of the Parts; they do all ſing Uniſons. Their Inſtruments are not well choſe, and it muſt be thought that thoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there appears any knowledge of Muſick, have them brought from other parts.</p>
                     <p>

Theſe Baſons are hung up by a ſtring, each has a Pole laid a-croſs upon two upright Forks: the one is called <hi>Schoungschang,</hi> and it is thinner, broader, and of a graver ſound than the other, which they call <hi>Cong.</hi>

                        </note>To this they add two ſorts of Drum, the <hi>Tlounpounpan,</hi> and the <hi>Tapon.</hi> The wood of the <hi>Tlounpounpan</hi> is about the ſize of our Timbrels, but it is cover'd with skin on both ſides like a true Drum, and on each ſide of the wood hangs a leaden ball to a ſtring. Beſides this the wood of the <hi>Tlounpounpan</hi> is run through with a ſtick which ſerves as a handle, by which it is held. They rowl it between their hands like a Chocolate-ſtick, only that the Chocolate ſtick is held inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the <hi>Tlounpounpan</hi> ſtrait: and by this motion which I have deſcribed, the Leaden Balls which hang down from each ſide of the <hi>Tlounpounpan,</hi> do ſtrike on each ſide upon the two Skins.</p>

                        </note>The <hi>Tapon</hi> reſembles a Barrel; they carry it before them, hung to the Neck by a Rope; and they beat it on the two Skins with each fiſt.</p>
                     <p>They have another Inſtrument compoſed of ......., which they call <hi>Pat-cong.</hi> The ...... are all placed ſucceſſively every one on a ſhort ſtick, and planted perpendicular on a demi-circumference of Wood, like to the felleys of a little Wheel of a Coach. He that plays on this Inſtrument is ſeated at the center croſs-legg'd; and he ſtrikes the ....... with two ſticks, one of which he holds in his right hand, and the other in his left. To me it ſeems that this Inſtrument had only a fifth redoubled in extent, but certainly there was not any half notes, nor any thing to ſtop the ſound of one ......., when another was ſtruck.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Conſort which follows the King in his Marches.</note>The March which they ſounded at the entrance of the Kings Ambaſſadors, was a confuſed noiſe with all theſe Inſtruments together: The like is ſounded in attending on the King of <hi>Siam;</hi> and this noiſe, as fantaſtical and odd as it is, has nothing unpleaſant, eſpecially on the River.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Inſtruments accompanying the Voice.</note>They ſometimes accompany the Voice with two ſhort ſticks, which they call <hi>Crab,</hi> and which they ſtrike one againſt the other; and he that ſings thus, is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tchang cap.</hi> They hire him at Weddings with ſeveral of thoſe Inſtruments I have mentioned. The people do alſo accompany the Voice in the Evening
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98501:44"/>
into the Courts of the Houſes, with a kind of Drum called <hi>Tong.</hi> They hold it with the Left hand, and ſtrike it continually with the Right hand. 'Tis an earthen Bottle without a bottom, and which inſtead thereof is covered with a Skin tyed to the Neck with Ropes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do extreamly love our Trumpets, theirs are ſmall and harſh,<note place="margin">Trumpets and Drums.</note>
they call them <hi>Tre;</hi> and beſides this they have true Drums, which they call <hi>Clong.</hi> But tho' their Drums be leſſer than ours, they carry them not hanging upon their Shoulder: They ſet them upon one of the Skins, and they beat them on the other, themſelves ſitting croſs-leg'd before their Drums. They do alſo make uſe of this ſort of Drum to accompany the Voice, but they ſeldom ſing with theſe Drums but to dance.</p>
                     <p>On the day of the firſt Audience of the King's Ambaſſadors,<note place="margin">They have falſe ones to make a ſhow.</note> there were in the innermoſt Court of the Palace an hundred Men lying proſtrate, ſome holding for ſhow thoſe ugly little Trumpets which they ſounded not, and which I ſuſpect to be of wood, and the others having before them every one a little Drum without beating it.</p>
                     <p>By all that I have ſaid,<note place="margin">The Exerciſes of the Body.</note> it appears that in ſome caſes the Mathematics are as much neglected at <hi>Siam,</hi> as the other Sciences. They have Exerciſes of the Body in no more Eſteem than thoſe of the Mind. They know not what the Art of Riding the Great Horſe is: Arms they have none, except the King gives them ſome; and they cannot purchaſe any, till he has given them ſome. They exerciſe them only by the Order of this Prince. They never fire the Muſquet ſtanding, no not in War: To diſcharge it, they place one Knee on the ground, and frequently proceed to ſit on their Heel, ſtretching forward the other Leg, which they have not bent. They hardly know to march, or keep themſelves on their Feet with a good grace. They never ſtretch out their Hams well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are accuſtomed to keep them bended. The <hi>French</hi> taught them how to ſtand to their Arms, and till the arrival of the King's Ships at <hi>Siam,</hi> their Sentinels themſelves ſat upon the ground. So far are they from running Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, purely for Recreation ſake, that they never walk abroad. The heat of the Climate cauſes a great Conſumption in them. Wreſtling, and Fiſty-cuffs, are the Jugler's Trade. The running of <hi>Balons</hi> is therefore their ſole Exerciſe. The Oar and <hi>Pagaye</hi> are in this Country the Trade of all the People from four or five years old. They can Row three days and three nights almoſt without reſting, altho' they cannot undergo any other Work.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THey have no Companies of Trades,<note place="margin">They are bad Artificers, and why.</note> and the Arts flouriſh not amongſt them, not only by reaſon of their natural ſluggiſhneſs, but much more by reaſon of the Government under which they live. There being no ſecurity for the wealth of particular perſons, but to conceal it well every one there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in ſo great a ſimplicity, that moſt of the Arts are not neceſſary to them, and that the Workmen cannot meet with the juſt value of the Works on which they would beſtow a great deal of Expence and Labour. Moreover, as every particular Perſon does Annually owe ſix Months ſervice to the King, and that frequently he is not diſcharged for ſix Months, there is no Perſon in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that dares to diſtinguiſh himſelf in any Art, for fear of being forced to work <hi>gratis</hi> all his life for the ſervice of this Prince. And becauſe that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently employ'd in theſe Works, every one applies himſelf to know how to do a little of all, to avoid the Baſtinados; but none would do too well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Servitude is the reward of Ingenuity. They neither know, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know how to do otherwiſe, than what they have always done. 'Tis no matter to them to have 500 Workmen, for ſeveral Months, upon what a few
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98501:45"/>
                        <hi>Europeans,</hi> well paid, would finiſh in a few days. If any Stranger gives them any direction, or any Machine, they forget it ſo ſoon as their Prince forgets it. Wherefore no <hi>European</hi> offers his ſervice to an <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, who is not receiv'd, as I may ſay, with open Arms. How little Merit ſoever he may have, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has more than the natural <hi>Indians;</hi> and not only for the Mechanic Arts, but for the Sea, and for Commerce, to which they are much more affected. The Inconvenience is, that the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings do well know the Secret, either of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching a Stranger only with hopes, or of detaining him amongſt them if they have really enrich'd him. Nothing is ſo magnificent as the Grants which the great <hi>Mogul</hi> gives: But is there found one <hi>European</hi> that has carry'd away much wealth out of his Service?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What Arts they exerciſe.</note>To return to the Induſtry of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> the Arts which they underſtand are theſe. They are reaſonable good Joyners, and becauſe they have no Nails, they very well underſtand how to faſten pieces together. They pretend to Sculpture, but groſly perform it. The Statues of their Temples are very ill made. They know how to burn Brick, and make excellent Ciments, and are not unskill'd in Maſonry. Nevertheleſs their Brick Buildings do not laſt, for want of Foundations: they do not make any, even in their Fortifications. They have no melted Cryſtal, nor Glaſs; and it is one of the things they moſt eſteem. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> was extreamly pleaſed with thoſe Foſſet-cut Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which multiply an Object; and he demanded entire Windows with the ſame property.</p>

                        </note>The Windows of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are compos'd with Threds of Glaſs as big as Straws, laid one by another, and glued at the ends to Paper, as we ſolder the Quarries of Glaſs into our Window-frames. They do frequently put ſome Paintings on theſe ſorts of Glaſſes, and with theſe Glaſſes thus painted, they ſometimes make Pannels of Screens, behind which they love to ſet ſome lights, becauſe they extreamly admire the Fancy of Illuminations.</p>

I have in my poſſeſſion a little <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> which is thus cover'd over with a Copper Plate gilded, and which is yet full of the Ciment, which ſerved as the Model. With ſuch a Plate of Gold or Silver they cover certain of their King's Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and the Iron hilt of the Sabres and Daggers, which he preſents to ſome of his Officers, and ſometimes to Strangers.

and Merchandize for all thoſe that have wherewith to follow it. I ſay all, not excepting their King himſelf. But the Foreign Trade being reſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entire to the King, the Home Trade is ſo inconſiderable, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to raiſe any competent Fortune thereby. That ſimplicity of Manners, which makes the <hi>Siameſes</hi> to let go moſt of the Arts, makes them alſo to ſlight moſt of the Commodities which are neceſſary to the <hi>Europeans;</hi> yet ſee how the <hi>Siameſes</hi> carry on their Commerce.</p>
                     <p>In their Loans, a third perſon, whoſoever he be, writes down the Promiſe;<note place="margin">What their private Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are.</note> and this ſufficeth them in Juſtice, becauſe it is determined againſt the word of the Debtor who denies, upon the double Teſtimony of him that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Promiſe, and of him that writ. It is neceſſary only that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the viewing of the Writing, that it is not the Creditor that writ the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, they ſign no Writings,<note place="margin">What their Signature is.</note> neither do they apply any Seal to private Writings. 'Tis only the Magiſtrates that have a Seal, that is properly a Seal which the King gives them as an Inſtrument of their Offices. Particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, inſtead of a Signature, do put a ſingle Croſs; and tho' this kind of Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be practiſed by all, yet every one knows the Croſs which is under his own hand; and it is very rare, they ſay, that any one is of a Reputation ſo bad as to diſown it in Juſtice. In a word, I ſhall tranſiently declare, that we muſt not ſearch out any Myſtery in that they ſign with a Croſs: 'Tis amongſt them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a kind of Flouriſh which they have preferr'd before any other, probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more plain.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid, that they endow the Virgins at their marrying;<note place="margin">They have no public Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nor No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</note> and that the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paid to the Husband in preſence of the Parents, but without any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I have ſaid alſo, that they make no Will, and that before their death they diſpoſe of their Eſtate with their own hand, and to whom they pleaſe, and that after this manner Cuſtom diſpoſes of their Inheritance. They Trade little with Immoveables, no perſon amongſt them thinking it ſafe to purchaſe Land of another; the Prince gives, or ſells thereof, to whoever would have it. But the real Property remaining always in him, is the reaſon that none in this Country does care to purchaſe much Land, nor to meliorate it, for fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing a deſire of it in one more powerful than himſelf. And thus needing no Writings of long continuance, they have not thought fit to have any Notaries.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſmall Trades, they are almoſt all of ſo little Conſequence,<note place="margin">The ſmall Trades.</note> and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity is there ſo great, that in the Bazars or Markets the Seller counts not the Money which he receives, nor the Buyer the Commodity, which he purchaſes by Tale. They were ſcandaliz'd to ſee the <hi>French</hi> buy the leaſt things with more Caution.</p>

They uſe it in Buildings, in ſurveying of Land, and perhaps in other things; and eſpecially in meaſuring the Roads, or Channels, through which the King generally paſſes. Thus from <hi>Siam</hi> to <hi>Louvo,</hi> every Mile is marked with a Poſt, on which they have writ the number of the Mile. The ſame thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Country of the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> where <hi>Bernier</hi> reports, that they mark the <hi>Koſſes,</hi> or Half-miles, with Tourrettes, or little Pyramids, and every one knows that the <hi>Romans</hi> denoted their Miles with Stones.</p>

As all the <hi>Coco's</hi> are naturally unequal, they meaſure the Capacity thereof by thoſe little Shells called <hi>Coris,</hi> which ſerve for ſmall Money at <hi>Siam,</hi> and which are not ſenſibly greater one than the other. There is therefore ſuch a <hi>Coco</hi> which contains a thouſand <hi>Coris,</hi> as ſome have informed me, ſuch an one which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains five hundred, and ſuch another more or leſs. To meaſure Corn they have a kind of <hi>Buſhel,</hi> called <hi>Sat</hi> in the <hi>Siameſe,</hi> which is made only with interlac'd Bambou; and to meaſure Liquors, they have a Pitcher called <hi>Canan</hi> in <hi>Siameſe, Choup</hi> in <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> and it is according to theſe ſorts of Meaſures, that they make their Markets. But for want of Policy, and a <hi>Standard,</hi> according to which the Meaſures ſhould legally be regulated, the Buyer accepts them only after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving meaſur'd them with his <hi>Coco,</hi> the Capacity of which he knows by the <hi>Coris;</hi> and he uſes either Water, or Rice, according as he would meaſure either the <hi>Canan</hi> or the <hi>Sat</hi> with his <hi>Coco.</hi> In a word, the quarter of the <hi>Canan</hi> is called <hi>Leeng,</hi> and forty <hi>Sats</hi> do make the <hi>Seſte,</hi> and forty <hi>Seſte's</hi> the <hi>Cohi.</hi> It is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the reſemblance which Meaſures ſo little exact have with ours.

Some inform'd me, as a thing very remarkable, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> ſold courſe Silver by weight, becauſe they had ſeen in the Market that Commodity in one of the Scales, and the ſilver Money which ſerv'd as a Weight in the other. The ſame Names do therefore ſignifie the Weights and Money both.</p>

Their Stamps (for they have two on each piece, ſtruck one at the ſide of the other in the middle of the Cylinder, and not at the ends) do repreſent nothing that we knew, and they have not explain'd them to me. The proportion of their Money to ours is, that their <hi>Tical,</hi> which weighs no more than half a Crown, is yet worth three ſhillings and three half-pence. I give the Figure and Size thereof, and at the end of this Work you will find their Meaſures for the Lengths, as well as their Coins and their Weights. They have no Gold, nor Copper-Money.

                        <note place="margin">The Glory of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Women.</note>There is not a vertuous Woman in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who in time of War chuſes not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that her Husband ſhould kill her, than that he ſhould ſuffer her to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Enemies. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the Twelfth Book of his <hi>Annals,</hi> gives an example thereof in <hi>Zenobia,</hi> the wife of <hi>Rhadamiſtus.</hi> The Husbands themſelves do think it the moſt ſhameful thing in the world to them, that their Wives ſhould fall into the Enemies hands; and when this happens, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affront that can be done them, is not to reſtore them their Wives. But tho the Women of <hi>Aſia</hi> be capable of ſacrificing their life to their glory, there ceaſes not to be ſome amongſt them, who take ſecret pleaſures when they can, and who hazard their glory and their life upon this account. 'Tis reported that there have been ſome examples hereof amongſt the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Wives: How cloſely ſoever they be ſhut up, they do ſometimes find out a way to have Lovers. Some have aſſur'd me, that the ordinary method by which this Prince puniſhes them, is firſt to ſubmit them to a Horſe, accuſtomed I know not how, to the love of Women, and then to put them to death. 'Tis ſome years ſince he gave one to the Tygers, and becauſe theſe Animals ſpared her at the firſt, he offered her a Pardon: but this Woman was ſo unworthy as to refuſe it, and with ſo many affronts, that the King looking upon her as diſtracted, ordered again that ſhe ſhould dye. They irritated the Tygers, and they tore her in pieces in his preſence. It is not ſo certain that he puts the Lovers to death, but at the leaſt he cauſes them to be ſeverely chaſtized. The common opinion at <hi>Siam</hi> is, that 'twas a fault of this nature, which cauſed the laſt diſgrace of the late <hi>Barcalon,</hi> elder Brother to the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s firſt Ambaſſadour to the King. The King his Maſter cauſed him to be very ſeverely baſtinado'd, and forbore to ſee him, yet without taking away his Offices. On the contrary, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to make uſe of him during the ſix months, that he ſurvived the blows which he had received; and he with his own hand prepared all the Remedies which the <hi>Barcalon</hi> took in his laſt ſickneſs, becauſe no perſon dared to give him any, for fear of being accuſed of the death of a man, who appeared ſo dear to his Maſter. <hi>Bernier</hi> relates ſome examples, by which it appears that the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> does not always puniſh the Women of his <hi>Seraglio</hi> that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their duty, nor the Men that are their Accomplices, with death. Theſe Princes conſider theſe ſorts of Crimes, like the others, which may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt their Majeſty, unleſs any ſentiment of Love renders them more ſenſible of Jealouſie.</p>

Nevertheleſs as it is not poſſible to have true Vertue, but in the eternal proſpects of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſeldome as I may ſay refuſe to ſteal whatever they meet with. 'Tis properly amongſt them that opportunity makes the Thief. They place the Idea of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Juſtice in not gathering up loſt things, that is to ſay in not laying hold on ſo eaſie an occaſion of getting. After the ſame manner the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to exaggerate the good Government of ſome of their Princes, do ſay that under their Reign Juſtice was in ſo high an eſteem among the People, that no perſon meddled with what he found ſcattered in the high Road; and this Idea has not been unknown to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Anciently in <hi>Greece</hi> the <hi>Stagyritae</hi> made a Law in theſe words: What you have not laid down take not up; and it is perhaps from them that <hi>Plato</hi> learned it, when he inſerted it amongſt his Laws.

                        </note> one of thoſe pious and learned Jeſuits which we carried to <hi>Siam,</hi> being one day alone in the Divan of their Houſe, a <hi>Siameſe</hi> came boldly to take away an excellent <hi>Perſian</hi> Carpet from off a Table that was before him: and Father <hi>d' Eſpagnac</hi> let him do it, becauſe he imagined not that he was a Robber. In the Journey which the King cauſed the Ambaſſadors from <hi>Siam</hi> to make into <hi>Flanders,</hi> one of the <hi>Mandarins</hi> which accompanied them, took twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Scions in a houſe, where the Ambaſſadors were invited to dine, as they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in one of the principal Cities of <hi>Picardy.</hi> The next day this <hi>Mandarin</hi> conceiving that theſe Scions were Money; gave one to a Footman to drink; and his Theft was hereby diſcovered, but no Notice taken thereof.</p>
                     <p>Behold likewiſe an ingenious prank, which proves that the opportunity of ſtealing has ſo much power over them, that it ſometimes ſways them, even when it is perilous. One of the Officers of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Magazines having ſtolen ſome Silver, this Prince ordered him to be put to death, by forcing him to ſwallow three or four Ounces of melted Silver, and it happened, that he who had order to take thoſe three or four Ounces of Silver out of that Wretch's throat, could not forbear filching part of it. The King therefore cauſed him to die of the ſame puniſhment, and a third expoſed himſelf to the ſame hazard by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the like Offence: I mean by ſtealing part of the Silver, which he took out of the laſt dead Man's throat. So that the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> pardoning him his Life, ſaid, there is enough puniſht, I ſhould deſtroy all my Subjects, if I ſhould not reſolve to pardon them at laſt.</p>
                     <p>It muſt not be doubted after this,<note place="margin">Robbers in the Woods of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> which do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely kill.</note> of what is reported of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> who live in the Woods, to withdraw themſelves from the Government, that they frequently rob the Paſſengers, yet without killing any. The Woods of <hi>China</hi> have been continually peſtered with ſuch Robbers: and there are ſome who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having enticed a great many Companions with them, have formed whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and at laſt rendered themſelves Maſters of that great Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, Fidelity is exceeding great at <hi>Siam,</hi> in all ſorts of Traffick,<note place="margin">The fidelity of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> in Commerce, their bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Uſury, and their Avarice.</note>
as I have elſewhere remarked: but Uſury is there practiſed without bounds. Their Laws have not provided againſt it, though their Morality prohibits it. Avarice is their eſſential Vice; and what is more wonderful herein, is that they heap not up riches to uſe them, but to bury them.</p>
                     <p>As they traffick not almoſt with immoveables, make no Wills,<note place="margin">They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revengful, and how.</note> nor publick Contracts, and as in a word they have no Notaries, it ſeems that they cannot almoſt have any Suits, and they have indeed few Civil, but a great many Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal cauſes. 'Tis principally out of ſpight that they exerciſe their ſecret Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds and Revenges; and they find facility therein with the Judges, who in this Country, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> do live on their profeſſion. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have naturally an averſion to blood: but when they hate, even unto death, which is very rare,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98501:49"/>
they aſſaſſinate, or they poyſon, and underſtand not the uncertain Revenge of Duels, yet moſt of their quarrels do terminate only in blows, or reciprocal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations.</p>

They are courteous, polite, fearful, and careleſs. They contain themſelves a long time, but when once their Rage is kindled, they have perhaps leſs diſcretion than we have. Their Timidity, their Avarice, their Diſſimulation, their Silences, their Inclination to lying do increaſe with them. They are ſtiff in their Cuſtoms, as much out of Idleneſs, as out of reſpect to their Anceſtors, who have tranſmitted them to them. They have no curioſity, and do admire nothing. They are proud with thoſe that deal gently with them, and humble to thoſe that treat them with rigour. They are ſubtile and variable, like all thoſe that perceive their own weakneſs.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the ſeveral Conditions among the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AT <hi>Siam</hi> all Perſons are either Freemen or Slaves.<note place="margin">Of the Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry according to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> The Maſter has all power over the Slave, except that of killing him: And tho' ſome may report, that Slaves are ſeverely beaten there, (which is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in a Country where free perſons are ſo rigidly baſtinado'd) yet the Slavery there is ſo gentile, or, if you will, the Liberty is ſo abject, that it is become a Proverb, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> ſell it to eat of a Fruit, which they call <hi>Durions.</hi> I have already ſaid, that they chuſe rather to enjoy it, than to enjoy none at all: 'Tis certain alſo, that they dread Beggary more than Slavery; and this makes me to think, that Beggary is there as painful as ignominious, and that the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> who expreſs a great deal of Charity for Beaſts, even to the reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, if they find any ſick in the Fields, have very little for the Men.</p>
                     <p>They employ their Slaves in cultivating their Lands and Gardens,<note place="margin">In what the Slaves are employed.</note> and in ſome domeſtic Services; or rather, they permit them to work to gain their livelihood, under a Tribute which they receive, from four to eight <hi>Ticals</hi> a Year, that is to ſay, from ſeven Livres ten Sols, to fifteen Livres.</p>
                     <p>One may be born, or become a Slave. One becomes ſo either for Debt,<note place="margin">A <hi>Siameſe</hi> may be born, or become a Slave.</note> as I have ſaid, or for having been taken Captive in War, or for having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated by Juſtice. When one is made a Slave for Debt, his Liberty returns again by making ſatisfaction; but the Children born during this Slavery, tho' it be but for a time, continue Slaves.</p>
                     <p>One is born a Slave, when born of a Mother-ſlave; and in the Slavery,<note place="margin">How he is born a Slave, and to whom he belongs.</note> the Children are divided as in the Divorce. The firſt, third, fifth, and all the reſt in the odd number belong to the Maſter of the Mother: the ſecond, fourth, and all the others in the even rank belong to the Father, if he is free; or to his Maſter, if he is a Slave. 'Tis true, that it is neceſſary upon this account, that the Father and Mother ſhould have had Commerce together, with the conſent of the Maſter of the Mother: for otherwiſe all the Children would belong to the Maſter of the Mother.</p>
                     <p>The difference of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Slaves from his Subjects of free condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that he continually employs his Slaves in perſonal labours,<note place="margin">
                           <p>The difference between the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Slaves, and his other Subjects. The Slaves of private men owe not any ſervice to the King.</p>
                           <p>Of the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe</hi> Nobility.</p>
                        </note> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them; whereas his free Subjects only owe him ſix months ſervice every Year, but at their own expence.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the Slaves of particular men owe not any ſervice to that Prince; and tho' for this Reaſon he loſes a Freeman, when this man falls into ſlavery, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Debt, or to avoid Beggary, yet this Prince oppoſes it not, neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends any Indemnity upon this account.</p>
                     <p>Properly ſpeaking, there is not two ſorts of Conditions among free perſons. Nobility is no other thing than the actual poſſeſſion of Offices, the Families
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98501:50"/>
which do long maintain themſelves therein, do become doubtleſs more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more powerful; but they are rare: and ſo ſoon as they have loſt their Offices, they have nothing, which diſtinguiſhes them from the common People. There is frequently ſeen at the <hi>Pagaye,</hi> the Grandſon of a Man who died a great Lord, and ſometimes his own Son.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the Prieſts or <hi>Talapoins.</hi>
                        </note>The diſtinction between the People and the Prieſts is only an uncertain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, ſeeing that one may continually paſs from one of theſe States to the other. The Prieſts are the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſpeak in the ſequel.

It belongs to the Prince to arm them, and give them Elephants or Horſes, if he would have them ſerve either on Elephants, or on Horſeback: but it belongs to them to cloath, and to maintain themſelves. And as the Prince never employs all his Subjects in his Armies, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſends no Army into the Field, though he be at War with ſome of his Neighbours, yet for ſix months in the year he employs in ſuch a work, or in ſuch a ſervice as pleaſes him, thoſe Subjects which he employs not in the War.</p>

                        </note> for they have another Title without Function, <hi>viz.

                     <p>But this word <hi>Oc</hi> is not <hi>Siameſe; Chief</hi> in <hi>Siameſe</hi> is called <hi>Houa,</hi>

The Lords of the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls</hi> Court are called, according to <hi>Bernier, Hazary, Dou-hazary, Penge, hecht,</hi> and <hi>Deh-hazary,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>One Thouſand, Two Thouſand, Five, Eight,</hi> and <hi>Ten Thouſand,</hi> as if one ſhould ſay, Lords over ſo many Thouſands of Horſe: though in reality they could neither maintain, nor command ſo great a number. The great <hi>Moguls</hi> eldeſt Son, he ſays, is called <hi>Twelve Thouſand,</hi> as if he had the effective command of Twelve Thouſand Horſe. 'Tis no ſtrange thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Subjects being eſteemed Soldiers, as thoſe of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> are eſteemed Horſemen, have equally aſſumed in both Courts the term of number, to expreſs the higheſt Dignities, and to name the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet I cannot affirm this is ſo at <hi>Siam,</hi> by reaſon that I know only that the words <hi>Pang</hi> and <hi>Meuing</hi> are <hi>Siameſe</hi> and numeral Terms: but as to the other names of Dignity, which I have mentioned, ſome have informed me that they are <hi>Balie,</hi> and that they underſtood them not. I know that in the Country of <hi>Laos</hi> the Dignities of <hi>Pa-ya</hi> and <hi>Meuang,</hi> and the honourable Epithets of <hi>Pra</hi> are in uſe; it may be alſo that the other Terms of Dignity are common to both Nations, as well as the Laws.</p>
                     <p>In reference to the ſix Dignities (for that of <hi>Oc-pan</hi> is obſolete,<note place="margin">Six orders of Cities of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> as I have ſaid) there are now at <hi>Siam</hi> ſix Orders of Cities, which have been anciently determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the Rolls of the Inhabitants. So that ſuch a City, which was then found very populous had a <hi>Pa ya</hi> for Governor, and ſuch which was leſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98501:51"/>
populous had an <hi>Oc-ya,</hi> and the reſt had alſo other Dignities in proportion to the Inhabitants which they contained. But it is not neceſſary to believe that theſe Cities have ever been ſo populous as the Titles of their Governors import; by reaſon, as I have often alledged, that theſe People are very proud in Titles. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt Titles were given to the Governors of the biggeſt Cities, and the leaſt Titles to the Governors of the Cities leſs inhabited. Thus the City of <hi>Me-Tac,</hi> of which I have ſpoken at the beginning, had a Governor called <hi>Pa-ya-Tac,</hi> and the word <hi>Me</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Mother,</hi> and which is joyned to <hi>Tac,</hi> ſeems to intimate that the City of <hi>Me-Tac</hi> was very great. The City of <hi>Porſelouc</hi> had alſo a <hi>Pa-ya; Tenaſſerim, Ligor, Corazema</hi> and other, have ſtill ſome <hi>Oc-ya.</hi> Leſſer Cities, as <hi>Pipeli</hi> and <hi>Bancock,</hi> have the <hi>Oc-pra,</hi> others have the <hi>Oc-Louang,</hi> or the <hi>Oc-Counnes,</hi> and the leaſt of all have the <hi>Oc-Meuing.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have tranſlated theſe Titles according to their fancy by thoſe of <hi>King, Vice-Roy, Duke, Marquis, Earl,</hi> &amp;c. They have given the Title of Kingdom to <hi>Metac, Tenaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, Porſelouc, Ligor,</hi> and <hi>Pipeli;</hi> either by reaſon of their hereditary Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or for having been like <hi>Pipeli</hi> the reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Siam;</hi> and to the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> they have given the Title of Emperor, becauſe the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> have ever thought the Title of Emperor ought to be given to Kings, that have other Kings for Feudataries: So that upon this ſingle reaſon ſome Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> have born the Title of Emperor, giving to their Children the Title of Kings of the ſeveral Kingdoms which were united to their Crown.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The dignities of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are not annext to the ſingle Governments of City or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note>To return to the Titles of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> they are given not only to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, but to all the Officers of the Kingdom; becauſe that they are all <hi>Nai:</hi> and the ſame Title is not always joyned to the ſame Office. The <hi>Barcalon,</hi> for example, has ſometimes had that of <hi>Pa-ya,</hi> as ſome have informed me, and now he has only that of <hi>Oc-ya.</hi> But if a Man has two Offices, he may have two different Titles in reſpect to his two Offices: and it is not rare that one Man has two Offices, one in the City and the other in the Province, or rather one in Title and the other by Commiſſion. Thus <hi>Oc-ya Pra-Sedet</hi> who is Governor of the City of <hi>Siam</hi> in Title, is now <hi>Oc-ya Barcalon</hi> by Commiſſion: the King of <hi>Siam</hi> finding it his intereſt, becauſe that upon this account he gives not to one Officer a double Sallery.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which this cauſes in Relations.</note>But this Multiplication of Offices on the ſame Head cauſes a great deal of Obſcurity and Equivocation in the ancient Relations of <hi>Siam;</hi> becauſe that when a man has two Offices, he has two Titles, and two Names, and when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation imports that ſuch an <hi>Oc-ya</hi> for example, is concerned in ſuch a thing, one is inclined to believe that the Relation has ſtil'd this <hi>Oc-ya</hi> by the title of the function which it attributes to him, and frequently it has named him by the title of another Office. Thus if a Relation of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> made by a <hi>Siameſe</hi> ſhould intimate, that the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> is General of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> the <hi>Siameſes</hi> might groundleſly perſwade themſelves, that every General of the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> bears the Title of Duke of <hi>Mayne.</hi> And this is what I had to ſay touching the People of <hi>Siam.</hi>

                        </note>THE <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have generally called all the Officers throughout the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Eaſt <hi>Mandarins;</hi> and it is probable that they have formed this word from that of <hi>Mandar,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies to <hi>command. Navaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> whom I have already cited, is of this opinion; and we may confirm it, becauſe that the <hi>Arabian</hi> word <hi>Emir,</hi> which is uſed at the Court of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and in ſeveral other Mahometan Courts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> to ſignifie the Officers, is derived from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Verb <hi>amara,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>command.</hi> The word <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98501:51"/>
extends alſo to the Children of the Principal Officers, which are conſidered as Children of Quality, called <hi>Mon</hi> in <hi>Siameſe.</hi> But I ſhall make uſe of the word <hi>Mandarin,</hi> only to ſignifie the Officers.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> therefore makes no conſiderable <hi>Mandarin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> gives Names to the conſiderable <hi>Mandarins.</hi>
                        </note> but he gives him a new Name; a Cuſtom eſtabliſhed alſo at <hi>China,</hi> and in other States of the Eaſt. This Name is always an <hi>Elogium;</hi> ſometimes it is purpoſely invented, like that which he gave to the Biſhop of <hi>Metelpolis,</hi> and like thoſe which he gives to the Forreigners that are at his Court; but oftentimes theſe Names are ancient, and known for having been formerly given to others; and thoſe are the moſt honourable, which have been heretofore born by perſons very highly advanced in Dignity, or by the Princes of the Royal Blood. And although ſuch Names be not always accompanied with Offices and Authority, they ceaſe not to be a great Mark of Favour. It likewiſe happens that the ſame Name is given to ſeveral perſons of different Dignities; ſo that at the ſame time the one, for example, will call himſelf, <hi>Oc-Pra Pipitcharatcha,</hi> and the other <hi>Oc-Counne Pipitcharatcha.</hi> Theſe Names, of which the firſt words are only ſpoken, and which do every one make a Period, are taken almoſt all entire out of the <hi>Baly</hi> Tongue, and are not always well underſtood: But this, and the Stile of the Laws, which participate very much of the <hi>Baly,</hi> and the Books of Religion, which are <hi>Baly,</hi> are the cauſe why the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> ought not to ignore this Tongue. Foraſmuch as, I have elſewhere ſaid, it lends all its Ornaments to the <hi>Siameſe,</hi> and that oftentimes they do elegantly intermix them, either in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or in writing.</p>
                     <p>The Law of the State is, that all Offices ſhould be hereditary;<note place="margin">All Offices are hereditary.</note> and the ſame Law is in the Kingdom of <hi>Laos,</hi> and was anciently at <hi>China.</hi> But the ſelling of Offices is not there permitted: and moreover the leaſt fault of the Patent, or the capricious Humor of the Prince, or the Dotage of the Inheritor may take away the Offices from the Families, and when this happens it is always without Recompence. Very few Families do long maintain themſelves therein, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Offices of the Court, which are more than the reſt under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's power.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, no Officer at <hi>Siam</hi> has any Sallary. The Prince lodges them,<note place="margin">The Profits of the Offices.</note>
which is no great matter; and gives them ſome moveables, as Boxes of Glod or Silver for <hi>Betel;</hi> ſome Arms, and a <hi>Balon;</hi> ſome Beaſts, as Elephants, Horſes, and Buffalo's; ſome Services, Slaves, and in fine ſome Arable Lands. All which return to the King with the Office, and which do principally make the King to be the Heir of his Officers. But the principal gain of the Offices conſiſts in Extorſions, becauſe that in this there is no Juſtice for the weak. All the Officers do hold a correſpondence in pillaging; and the Corruption is greateſt in thoſe from whence the Remedy ought to come. The Trade of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents is publick; the leaſt Officers do give unto the greateſt, under a Title of Reſpect; and a Judge is not there puniſhed for having received Preſents, if otherwiſe he be not convicted of Injuſtice, which is not very eaſie to do.</p>
                     <p>The Form of the Oath of Fidelity conſiſts in ſwallowing the water,<note place="margin">The Oath of Fidelity.</note> over which the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do pronounce ſome Imprecations againſt him, who is to drink it, in caſe he fails in the Fidelity which he owes to his King. This Prince diſpenſes not with this Oath to any perſons that engage themſelves in his Service, of what Religion or Nation ſoever.</p>
                     <p>The Publick Law of <hi>Siam</hi> is written in three Volumes.<note place="margin">The Publick Law of <hi>Siam</hi> is written.</note> The firſt is called <hi>Pra Tam Ra,</hi> and contains the Names, Functions, and Prerogatives of all the Offices. The ſecond is intituled, <hi>Pra Tam Non,</hi> and is a Collection of the Conſtitutions of the Ancient Kings; and the third is the <hi>Pra Rayja Cammanot,</hi> wherein are the Conſtitutions of the now Regent King's Father.</p>
                     <p>Nothing would have been more neceſſary than a faithful extract of theſe three Volumes,<note place="margin">The difficulty of procuring the Books thereof.</note> rightly to make known the Conſtitution of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam:</hi> but ſo far was I from being able to get a Tranſlation, that I could not procure a Copy thereof in <hi>Siameſe.</hi> It would have been neceſſary upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to continue longer at <hi>Siam,</hi> and with leſs buſineſs. This is therefore what I could learn certainly about this matter, without the aſſiſtance of thoſe Books,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98501:52"/>
and in a Country where every one is afraid to ſpeak. The greateſt token of Servitude of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> is, that they dare not to open their mouth about any thing that relates to their Country.</p>

The upper lies towards the North, (ſeeing that the River deſcends from thence) and contains ſeven Provinces, which are named by their Chief Cities, <hi>Porſelouc, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelouc, Lacontai, Campeng-pet, Coconrepina, Pechebonne,</hi> and <hi>Pitchai.</hi> At <hi>Porſelouc</hi> do immediately ariſe ten Juriſdictions, at <hi>Sanquelouc</hi> eight, at <hi>Lacontai</hi> ſeven, at <hi>Campeng-pet</hi> ten, at <hi>Coconrepina</hi> five, at <hi>Pechebonne</hi> two, and at <hi>Pitchai</hi> ſeven. And beſides this there are in the upper <hi>Siam</hi> one and twenty other Juriſdictions, to which no other Juriſdiction reſorts; but which do reſort to the Court, and are as ſo many little Provinces.</p>
                     <p>In the lower <hi>Siam,</hi> that is to ſay in the South part of the Kingdom, they reckon the Provinces of <hi>Jor, Patana, Ligor, Tenaſſerim, Chantebonne, Petelong</hi> or <hi>Bordelong,</hi> and <hi>Tchiai.</hi> On <hi>Jor</hi> do immediately depend ſeven Juriſdictions, on <hi>Patana</hi> eight, on <hi>Ligor</hi> twenty, on <hi>Tenaſſerim</hi> twelve, on <hi>Chantebonne</hi> ſeven, on <hi>Petelong</hi> eight, and on <hi>Tchiai</hi> two. And beſides this, there are likewiſe in the lower <hi>Siam</hi> thirteen ſmall Juriſdictions, which are as ſo many particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which reſort only to the Court, and to which no other Juriſdiction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts.

But the moſt important prerogative of the Preſident is to be the Governour of his whole Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and to command even the Garriſons, if there be any; unleſs the Prince hath otherwiſe diſpoſed thereof by an expreſs order. So that as in other places theſe Offices are hereditary, it is no difficult matter for ſome of theſe Governors, and eſpecially the moſt powerful, and for the moſt remote from Court, to withdraw themſelves wholly or in part from the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                        <hi>Oc-Counne Nai-rang</hi> is the Purveyor of the Elephants.

Every one of the Officers within has his Lieutenant, in <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe Balat,</hi> and his Regiſter in <hi>Siameſe Semien,</hi> and in his Houſe, which the King gives him, he has generally an Hall to give his Audiences.</p>

                        </note>The Governor then admits the Petition, and refers it to one of the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; and ordinarily he returns it to him that preſented it, if he is the common <hi>Nai</hi> of both parties: but then he puts his Seal thereunto, and he counts the lines and the cancelling thereof, to the end that no alteration may be made. The Councellor gives it to his Deputy and to his Clerk, who make their report to him at his Houſe in his Hall of Audience: And this report, and all thoſe which I ſhall treat of in the ſequel, are only a Lecture.

This Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation not ſucceeding, the Court orders, if there are witneſſes, that they ſhould be heard before the ſame Clerk, unleſs he be declared ſuſpected. And in ſuch another Seſſion, that is to ſay, where the Governor is not preſent, the Clerk reads the Proceſs and the depoſitions of the Witneſſes, and they proceed to the Opinions, which are only conſultative, and which are all writ down, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Opinion of the laſt Officer.</p>

They do there ſeek out ſome accommodations under the title of Equity; and under pretence that all the circumſtances of the fact are never in the Law, they never follow the Law. The Governour alone decides theſe diſputes, and the Sentence is pronounced upon the parties, and ſet down in Writing.

                        <note place="margin">The Proof of the Fire.</note>In the Proof of Fire they erect a Pile of Faggots in a Ditch, in ſuch a manner that the ſurface of the Pile be level with the edge of the Ditch. This Pile is five fathomslong, and one broad. Both the parties do walk with their naked Feet from one end to the other, and he that has not the ſole of his Feet hurt gains his Suit. But as they are accuſtomed to go with naked Feet, and that they have the ſole of the Foot hard like Horn, they ſay that it is very common that the Fire ſpares them, provided they reſt the Foot upon the Coals: for the way to burn themſelves is to go quick and lightly. Two men do generally walk by the ſide of him that paſſes over the Fire, and they lean with force upon his Shoulders, to hinder him from getting too quick over this proof: and it is ſaid that this weight is ſo far from expoſing him more to be burnt, that on the contrary he ſtifles the Action of the Fire under his Feet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98501:54"/>Sometimes the proof of the Fire is performed with Oil,<note place="margin">Another ſort of Proof by Fire.</note> or other boiling matter, into which the parties do thruſt their hand. A <hi>Frenchman,</hi> from whom a <hi>Siameſe</hi> had ſtole ſome Tin, was perſwaded, for want of proof, to put his hand into the melted Tin; and he drew it out almoſt conſumed.

But a Thouſand ſuch like events perſwade not the <hi>Siameſes</hi> to change their form.</p>
                     <p>The Proof of the Water is performed after this manner.<note place="margin">The Proof of the Water.</note> The two parties do plunge themſelves into the Water at the ſame time, each holding by a Pole, along which they deſcend; and he that remains longeſt under Water is thought to have a good Cauſe. Every one therefore practiſes from their Youth, in this Country, to familiarize himſelf with Fire, and to continue a long time under Water.</p>
                     <p>They have another ſort of Proof,<note place="margin">A Proof by Vomits.</note> which is performed by certain Pills prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> and accompanied with Imprecations: Both the parties do ſwallow them, and the token of the right Cauſe is to be able to keep them in the Stomach without caſting them up, for they are vomitive.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Proofs are not only before the Judges, but before the People,<note place="margin">The various ſucceſſes of theſe Proofs.</note> and if the two parties do eſcape equally well, or equally ill with one, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another Tryal. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> uſes them alſo in his Judgments, but beſides this he ſometimes delivers up the parties to Tygers, and he whom the Tygers ſpare for a certain time is adjudged innocent. But if the Tygers devour them both, they are both eſteemed guilty. If on the contrary the Tygers do meddle neither with the one nor the other, they have recourſe to ſome other Proof, or rather they wait till the Tygers determine to devour one or both of the Parties. The Conſtancy with which it is reported that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this kind of death, is incredible in perſons, who expreſs ſo little Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in War.</p>
                     <p>There are ſometimes ſeveral Provinces which appeal one to the other;<note place="margin">The Degrees of Appeal.</note> which multiplies the degrees of Appeal to three or four. An Appeal is permitted in all caſes, but the charges thereof are always greater, as it is neceſſary to travel further to plead, and in a Tribunal ſuperior,</p>
                     <p>But when there ought to paſs the ſentence of Death,<note place="margin">Judgments of Death reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Prince, or to ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</note> the deciſion thereof is reſerved to the King alone. No other Judge than himſelf can order a capital puniſhment, if this Prince does not expreſly grant him the power thereof; and there is hardly any precedent, that he grants it otherwiſe than to ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Judges, whom this Prince ſends ſometimes into the Provinces, either upon a particular caſe, or to execute Juſtice at the places of all the crimes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death. All the Criminals are kept in the Priſons till the arrival of the Commiſſioners: and they have ſometimes, as at <hi>China,</hi> the power of depoſing and puniſhing the ordinary Officers with death, if they deſerve it. But if the King of <hi>Siam</hi> grants other Commiſſions for his Service, or for the Service of the State, it is rare that he exempts the Commiſſioner from taking the aſſiſtance of the Governor of the places where he ſends him.</p>
                     <p>The uſual Puniſhment of Robbery is the Condemnation to the double,<note place="margin">The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery extended to Eſtates.</note> and ſometimes to the triple; by equal portions to the Judge and Party: But it is moſt ſingular in this, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> extend the Puniſhment of Robbery to every unjuſt Poſſeſſor in a Real Eſtate: So that whoever it evicted out of an Inheritance by Law, not only reſtores the Inheritance to the Party, but likewiſe pays the value thereof, half to the Party, and half to the Judge. But if by the King's ſpecial permiſſion the Judge can put the Robber to death, then he can at his own diſcretion order either Death, or the pecuniary Mulct, but not Death and the pecuniary Mulct together.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhow how dear Juſtice is in a Country, where Proviſions are ſo cheap, I will add at the end of this work, a Note that was given me of the charges of Juſtice, where you will likewiſe ſee a particular of the form: but the charges are not the ſame in all the Tribunals, as I have already declared.

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Concerning the Art of War amongſt the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and of their Forces by Sea and Land.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> not proper for War.</note>THe Art of War is exceedingly ignor'd at <hi>Siam:</hi> the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to this Trade. The over-quick imagination of the exceſſive hot Countries, is not more proper for Courage, than the ſlow imagination of Countries extreamly cold. The ſight of a naked Sword is ſufficient to put an hundred <hi>Siameſes</hi> to flight; there needs only the aſſured Tone of an <hi>European,</hi> that wears a Sword at his ſide, or a Cane in his hand, to make them forget the moſt expreſs Orders of their Superiors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible the men in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> are as to their Courage.</note>I ſay moreover, that every one born in the <hi>Indies</hi> is without Courage; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be born of <hi>European</hi> Parents. And the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> born in the <hi>Indies</hi> have been a real proof thereof. A ſociety of <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants found in them only the Name and the Language, and not the Bravery of the <hi>Portugueſe:</hi> and if other <hi>Europeans</hi> went to ſeek out the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they would not be found more Valorous. The beſt conſtituted men are thoſe of the Temperate Zones: and amongſt theſe the difference of their common aliments, and of the places which they inhabit, more or leſs hot, dry or moiſt, expoſed to the Winds or to the Seas, Plains or Mountains. Woods or Champains, and much more the ſeveral Governments do cauſe very great differences. For who doubts, for example, that the Antient <hi>Greeks,</hi> brought up in liberty, where incomparably more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous then the preſent <hi>Greeks,</hi> depreſſed by ſo long a Servitude? All theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do concur to effeminate the Courage of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> I mean the heat of the Climate, the flegmatick Aliments, and the Deſpotick Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> abhor blood.</note>The Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> inſpiring them with an horror of blood, deprives them likewiſe of the Spirit of War. They buſie themſelves only in making Slaves. If the <hi>Peguins,</hi> for example, do on one ſide invade the lands of <hi>Siam,</hi> the <hi>Siameſes</hi> will at another place enter on the Lands of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and both Parties will carry away whole Villages into Captivity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of killing their Enemies.</note>But if the Armies meet, they will not ſhoot directly one againſt the other, but higher: and yet as they endeavour to make theſe random Shots to fall back upon the Enemies, to the end that they may be overtaken therewith, if they do not retreat, one of the two Parties do's not long defer from taking flight, upon perceiving it never ſo little to rain Darts or Bullets. But if the deſign be to ſtop the Troops that come upon them, they will ſhoot lower than it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; to the end that if the Enemies approach, the fault may be their own in coming within the reach of being wounded or ſlain. <hi>Kill not</hi> is the order, which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> gives his Troops, when he ſends them into the Field: which cannot ſignifie that they ſhould not kill abſolutely, but that they ſhoot not directly upon the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How the King of <hi>Singor</hi> was taken by a Frenchman.</note>Some have upon this account informed me a thing, which in my opinion, will appear moſt incredible. 'Tis of a provincial named <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who is ſtill at <hi>Surat</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Company's Service, if he has not quitted it, or if he is not lately dead: the name of his Family I know not. Before his entrance into the Companies ſervice, he had ſerved ſome time in the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Army in quality of Canoneer; and becauſe he was prohibited from ſhooting ſtrait, he doubted not that the <hi>Siameſe</hi> General would betray the King his Maſter. This Prince ſending afterwards ſome Troops againſt the <hi>Tchaou-Meuang,</hi> or if you will, againſt the King of <hi>Singor,</hi> on the weſtern Coaſt of the Gulph of <hi>Siam, Cyprian</hi> wearied with ſeeing the Armies in view, which attempted no perſons life, determin'd one night to go alone to the Camp of the Rebels, and to fetch the King of <hi>Singor</hi> into his Tent. He took him indeed, and brought him to the <hi>Siameſe</hi> General, and ſo terminated a War of above twenty years. The King
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98501:56"/>
of <hi>Siam</hi> intended to recompence this ſervice of <hi>Cyprian</hi> with a quantity of <hi>Sapan</hi>-wood; but by ſome intrigue of Court he got nothing, and retir'd to <hi>Surat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now though the <hi>Siameſes</hi> appear to us ſo little proper for War,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have little to fear from their Neighbours. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Troops maintain'd than his fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Guard.</note> yet they ceaſe not to make it frequently and advantageouſly, by reaſon that their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are neither more potent nor more valiant than them.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has no other Troops maintained than his foreign Guard, of which I will ſpeak in the ſequel. 'Tis true that the Chevalier <hi>de Fourbin</hi> had ſhowed the Exerciſe of Arms to four hundred <hi>Siameſes,</hi> which we found at <hi>Bancock:</hi> and that after he had quitted this Kingdom, an Engliſhman, who had been a Sergeant in the Garriſon of <hi>Madraſpatan,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> ſhowed this ſame exerciſe, which he had learnt under the Chevalier <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> to about eight hundred other <hi>Siameſes,</hi> to ſhow the King of <hi>Siam</hi> that the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Fourbin</hi> was not neceſſary to him. But all theſe Soldiers have no other pay, than the Exemption from the ſix Months Service for ſome of their Family. And as they cannot eaſily maintain themſelves from their own Houſes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they receive no money, they remain at their own Habitations; the four hundred about <hi>Bancock,</hi> and the other eight hundred at <hi>Louvo,</hi> or thereabouts. Only for the ſecurity of <hi>Bancock</hi> ſome Detachments went thither by turns to keep a continual Guard, and the reſt being thereabouts might render themſelves in caſe of an Alarm. But according to the common practice of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> the Garriſons which it may have, are compoſed of perſons, who ſerve in this by ſix Months, as they ſhould ſerve in another thing; and who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by others when they have ſerved their full time.</p>
                     <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> being very ſtrong by its impenetaable Woods,<note place="margin">The Country of <hi>Siam</hi> is very ſtrong without Forts.</note> and by the great number of Channels, wherewith it is interſperſed, and in fine by the annual Innundation of ſix Months, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> would not hitherto have places well fortified for fear of loſing them, and not being able to retake them; and this is the reaſon they gave me thereof. The Caſtles they have would hardly ſuſtain the firſt ſhock of our Soldiers; and though they be ſmall and ugly, becauſe they would have them ſuch, yet is it neceſſary to employ the skill of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> to delineate them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſome years ſince the King of <hi>Siam</hi> deſigning to make a wooden Fort on the Frontier of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> know not how to make a wooden Fort.</note> had no abler a perſon to whom he could entruſt the care thereof, than to one named Brother <hi>Rene Charbonneau,</hi> who after having been a Servant of the Miſſion of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Lazarus</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> had paſſed to the Service of the Foreign Miſſions, and was gone to <hi>Siam.</hi> Brother <hi>Rene,</hi> who by his Induſtry knew how to let blood, and give a Remedy to a ſick Perſon (for it is by ſuch like charitable Employments, and by ſome preſents, that the Miſſionaries are permitted and loved in this Country) defended himſelf as much as he could from making this Fort, proteſting that he was not capable: but in ſhort he could not prevent rendering obedience, when it was ſignified to him that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> abſolutely requir'd it. He was afterwards three or four years Governor of <hi>Jonſalam</hi> by Commiſſion, and with great approbation: and becauſe he deſired to return to the City of <hi>Siam</hi> to his Wife's Relations, which are <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Billi,</hi> the Maſter of Mr. <hi>de Chaumont</hi>'s Palace, ſucceeded him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of <hi>Jonſalam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have not much Artillery. A <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of <hi>Macao,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</note> who died in their ſervice, caſt them ſome pieces of Cannon; but as for them, I queſtion whether they know how to make any moderately good: though ſome have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that they have hammered ſome out of cold Iron.</p>
                     <p>As they have no Horſes (for what is two thouſand Horſe at moſt,<note place="margin">In what their Armies conſiſt.</note> which 'tis reported that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> keeps?) their Armies conſiſt only in Elephants, and in Infantry, naked and ill armed, after the mode of the Country. Their order of Battel and Encampment is thus.</p>
                     <p>They range themſelves in three lines,<note place="margin">What is their order of battle and of their Encampments.</note> each of which is compoſed of three great ſquare Battalions; and the King, or the General whom he names in his abſence, ſtands in the middle Battalion, which he compoſes of the beſt Troops, for the ſecurity of his Perſon. Every particular Captain of a Battalion keeps himſelf alſo in the midſt of the Battalion which he commands: and if the nine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98501:57"/>
Battalions are too big, they are each divided into nine leſs, with the ſame ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry as the whole body of the Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Elephants of War.</note>The Army being thus ranged, every one of the nine Battalions has ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen male Elephants in the rear. They call them Elephants of War: and each of theſe Elephants carries his particular ſtandard, and is accompanied with two female Elephants; but as well females as males are mounted each with three armed Men; and beſides this the Army has ſome Elephants with Baggage. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> report that the female Elephants are only for the dignity of the males; but as I have already declared in the other part, it would be very difficult al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to govern the males without the Company of the females.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Artillery begins the Fight.</note>The Artillery, at the places where the River grows ſhallow, is carried on Waggons drawn by Buffalo's, or Oxen, for it has no carriage. It begins the Fight, and if it ends it not, then they place themſelves within reach to make uſe of the ſmall ſhot, and Arrows, after the manner as I have explained, but they never fall on with vigour enough, nor defend themſelves with conſtancy enough, to come to a cloſe Fight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> eaſie to break, and to rally.</note>They break themſelves and fly into Woods, but ordinarily they rally with the ſame facility. as they are broken; and if on ſome occaſion, as in the laſt Conſpiracy of the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> it is abſolutely neceſſary to ſtand firm, they can promiſe themſelves to retain the Soldiers, only by placing ſome Officers behind, to kill thoſe that ſhall fly. I have elſewhere related how theſe <hi>Macaſſars</hi> made uſe of Opium to endow themſelves with Courage: 'tis a cuſtom practiſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the <hi>Ragipouts,</hi> and the <hi>Melays,</hi> but not by the <hi>Siameſes:</hi> the <hi>Siameſes</hi> would be afraid to become too Couragious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Elephants not proper for War.</note>They very much rely upon the Elephants in Combats, though this Animal for want of Bitt or Bridle, cannot be ſecurely governed, and he frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns upon his own Maſters when he is wounded. Moreover he ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreads the fire, that he is never almoſt accuſtomed thereunto. Yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them to carry, and to ſee fired from their back little pieces about three foot long, and about a pound of Ball; and <hi>Bernier</hi> reports that this very practice is obſerved in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> incapable of Sieges.</note>As for Sieges they are wholly incapable thereof, for men that dare not ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemies when in view, will not vigorouſly attack a place never ſo little Fortified, but only by Treachery, in which they are very cunning, or by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, if the Beſieged cannot have proviſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Sea.</note>They are yet more ſeeble by Sea than by Land. Not without much ado the King of <hi>Siam</hi> hath five or ſix very ſmall Ships, which he principally makes uſe of for Merchandize; and ſometimes he arms them as Privateers againſt thoſe of his Neighbours, with whom he is at War. But the Officers and Seamen, on whom he confides, are Foreigners; and till theſe latter times he had choſen <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe:</hi> but within theſe few years he hath employed ſome <hi>French.</hi> The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Intention is, that his Corſairs ſhould kill no perſon, no more than his Land Forces, but that they uſe all the Tricks imaginable to take ſome Prizes. In his War at Sea, he propoſes to himſelf only ſome Reprizals from ſome of his Neighbours, from whom he believes himſelf to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome injury in Trade.

They are only moderate Boats for a Bridge, which do every one carry fifty or ſixty men to Row and to Fight. Theſe men do fight by turns, as in every thing elſe: There is only one to each Oar; and he is obliged to Row ſtanding, becauſe the Oar is ſo ſhort, for lightneſs ſake, that it would not touch the water, if not held almoſt perpendicular. Theſe Gallies only coaſt it along the Gulph of <hi>Siam.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the <hi>Barcalon,</hi> and of the Revenues.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Pra-Clang,</hi> or by a corruption of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> the <hi>Barcalon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Barca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                        </note> is the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer which has the appointment of the Commerce, as well within as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom. He is the Superintendent of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Magazines, or if you will, his chief Factor. His name is compoſed of the <hi>Balie</hi> word <hi>Pra,</hi> which I have ſo often diſcourſed of, and of the word <hi>Clang,</hi> which ſignifies Magazine. He is the Miniſter of the foreign affairs, becauſe they almoſt all relate to Commerce; and 'tis to him that the fugitive Nations at <hi>Siam</hi> addreſs themſelves in their affairs, becauſe 'tis only the liberty of Trade that formerly invited them thither. In a word, it is the <hi>Barcalon</hi> that receives the Revenues of the Cities.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Revenues are of two ſorts, Revenues of the Cities,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ariſe from two Sources.</note> and Revenues of the Country. The Country Revenues are received by <hi>Oc ya Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latep,</hi> according to ſome, or <hi>Vorethep,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Gervaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are all reduced to the Heads following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. On Forty Fathom Square of cultivated Lands,<note place="margin">His Duties on cultivated Lands.</note> a <hi>Mayon</hi> or quarter of a <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> by year: but this Rent is divided with the <hi>Tchaou-Meuang</hi> where there is one; and it is never well paid to the King on the Frontiers. Beſides this, the Law of the Kingdom is, that whoever ploughs not his ground pays nothing, though it be by his own negligence that he reaps nothing. But the preſent King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> to force his Subjects to work, has exacted this duty from thoſe that have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Lands for a certain time, although they omit to cultivate them. Yet this is executed only in the places where his Authority is abſolute. He loved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as to ſee Strangers come to ſettle in his States, there to manure thoſe great uncultivated Spaces, which without compariſon do make the moſt conſiderable part thereof: in this caſe he would be liberal of untilled grounds, and of Beaſts to cultivate them, though they had been cleared and prepared for Tillage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On Boats or <hi>Balons,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">On Boats.</note> the Natives of the Country pay a <hi>Tical</hi> for every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom in length. Under this Reign they have added that every <hi>Balon</hi> or Boat above ſix Cubits broad ſhould pay ſix <hi>Ticals,</hi> and that Foreigners ſhould be obliged to this duty, as well as the Natives of the Country. This duty is levied like a kind of Cuſtom at certain places of the River, and amongſt others at <hi>Tchainat,</hi> four Leagues above <hi>Siam,</hi> where all the Streams unite.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Cuſtoms on whatever is imported or exported by Sea. Beſides which,<note place="margin">Cuſtomes.</note>
the body of the Ship pays ſomething in proportion to its Capacities, like the <hi>Balons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. On <hi>Arak</hi> or Rice-Brandy, or rather on every Furnace where it is made,<note place="margin">On <hi>Arak.</hi>
                        </note>
which they call <hi>Taou-laou,</hi> the People of the Country do pay a <hi>Tical per Annum.</hi> This Duty has been doubled under this Reign, and is exacted on the Natives of the Country, and on Strangers alike. 'Tis likewiſe added, that every Seller of <hi>Arak</hi> by re-tail, ſhould pay a <hi>Tical</hi> a year, and every Seller by whole-ſale, a <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal per Annum</hi> for every great Pot, the ſize of which, I find no otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Note which was given me.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. On the Fruit called <hi>Durion,</hi> for every Tree already bearing,<note place="margin">On <hi>Durions.</hi>
                        </note> or not bearing Fruit, two <hi>Mayons</hi> or half a <hi>Tical per annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. On every Tree of <hi>Betel,</hi> a <hi>Tical per annum.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">On <hi>Betel.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. On every <hi>Arekier</hi> they formerly paid three Nuts of <hi>Arek</hi> in kind:<note place="margin">On the <hi>Arek.</hi>
                        </note> under this Reign, they pay ſix.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Revenues entirely new, or eſtabliſhed under this Reign,<note place="margin">New Impoſts.</note> are in the firſt place, a certain Duty on a School of Recreation permitted at <hi>Siam.</hi> The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which the <hi>Oc-ya Meen</hi> pays, is almoſt of the ſame Nature, but I know not whether it is not ancienter than the former. In the ſecond place, on every <hi>Coco</hi>-Tree,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98501:58"/>
half a <hi>Tical per Annum;</hi> and in the third place on Orange-Trees, Mango-Trees, Mangouſtaniers and Pimentiers, for each, a <hi>Tical per Annum.</hi> There is no duty on Pepper, by reaſon that the King would have his Subjects addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more to plant it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">A Demeſn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the King.</note>9. This Prince has in ſeveral places of his States ſome Gardens and Lands, which he cauſes to be cultivated, as his particular demeſn, as well by his Slaves, as by the ſix Months Service. He cauſes the Fruits to be gathered and kept on the places, for the maintenance of his Houſe, and for the nouriſhment of his Slaves, his Elephants, his Horſes, and other Cattle; and the reſt he ſells.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A Caſual Revenue is the Preſents which this Prince receives, as well as all the Officers of his Kingdom, the Legacies which the Officers bequeath him at their death, or which he takes from their Succeſſion; and in fine, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Duties, which he takes from his Subjects on ſeveral occaſions: as for the Maintenance of Foreign Ambaſſadors, to which the Governors, into whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction the Ambaſſadors do paſs, or ſojourn, are obliged to contribute; and for the building of Forts, and other publick works, an expence which he levies on the People, amongſt whom theſe works are made.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <note place="margin">Confiſcations and Fines. Six Months Service.</note>11. The Revenues of Juſtice do donſiſt in Confiſcations and Fines.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Six Months ſervice of every one of his Subjects <hi>per Annum:</hi> a Service which he or his Officers frequently extend much further, who alone diſcharges it from every thing, and from which there remains to him a good Increaſe. For in certain places this Service is converted into a payment made in Rice, or in Sapan-wood, or Lignum-aloes, or Saltpetre, or in Elephants, or in Beaſts Skins, or in Ivory, or in other Commodities: and in fine, this Service is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eſteemed and paid in ready Money; and it is for the ready Money that the Rich are exempted. Anciently this Service was eſteemed at a <hi>Tical</hi> a Month, becauſe that one <hi>Tical</hi> is ſufficient to maintain one Man: and this computation ſerves likewiſe as an aſſeſſment on the days Labour of the Workmen, which a particular Perſon employs. They amount to two <hi>Ticals</hi> a Month at leaſt, by reaſon that it is reckon'd that a Workman muſt in 6 Months gain his Maintenance for the whole year; ſeeing that he can get nothing the other ſix Months that he ſerves the Prince. The Prince now extorts two <hi>Ticals</hi> a Month for the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſix Months Service.</p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <note place="margin">Commerce, a Revenue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or caſual.</note>13. His other Revenues do ariſe from the Commerce, which he exerciſes with his Subjects and Foreigners. He has carried it to ſuch a degree, that Merchandize is now no more the Trade of particular perſons at <hi>Siam.</hi> He is not contented with ſelling by Whole-ſale, he has ſome Shops in the Bazars or Markets, to ſell by Re-tail</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cotton-cloath.</note>The principal thing that he ſells to his Subjects is Cotton-cloath: he ſends them into his Magazines of the Provinces. Heretofore his Predeceſſors and he ſent them thither only every Ten Years, and a moderate quantity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſold, particular perſons had liberty to make Commerce thereof: now he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually furniſhes them, he has in his Magazines more than he can poſſibly ſell; and it ſometimes happens that to vend more, that he has forced his Subjects to cloath their Children before the accuſtomed Age. Before the <hi>Hollanders</hi> came into the Kingdom of <hi>Laos,</hi> and into others adjacent, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> did there make the whole Commerce of Linnen with a conſiderable profit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Calin</hi> or Tin.</note>All the <hi>Calin</hi> is his, and he ſells it as well to Strangers as to his own Subjects, excepting that which is dug out of the Mines of <hi>Jonſalam</hi> on the Gulph of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal:</hi> for this being a remote Frontier, he leaves the Inhabitants in their ancient Rights, ſo that they enjoy the Mines which they dig, paying a ſmall profit to this Prince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ivory, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre, Lead, Sapan.</note>All the Ivory comes to the King, his Subjects are obliged to vend him all that they ſell, and Strangers can buy only at his Magazine. The Trade of Saltpetre, Lead and Sapan, belongs alſo to the King: they can buy and ſell them only at his Magazine, whether one be a <hi>Siameſe</hi> or Stranger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Arek.</note>
                        <hi>Arek,</hi> a great deal of which is exported out of the Kingdom, can be ſold to Foreigners only by the King: and for this end he buys ſome of his Subjects, beſides that which he has from his particular Revenues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98501:58"/>Prohibited Goods, as Powder, Sulphur and Arms,<note place="margin">Prohibited Goods. Skins of Beaſts.</note> can be bought or ſold at <hi>Siam,</hi> only at the King's Magazine.</p>
                     <p>As to the Skins of Beaſts, this Prince is obliged, by a Treaty made with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to ſell them all to them; and for this purpoſe he buys them of his Subjects: but his Subjects do convey away a great many, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> buy of them in ſecret.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the Commerce at <hi>Siam</hi> is permitted to all, as that of Rice, Fiſh,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce free to all perſons.</note>
Salt, Brown Sugar, Sugar-Candy, Ambergreeſe, Wax, the Gum with which Varniſh is made, Mother of Pearl, thoſe edable Birds-Neſts which come from <hi>Tonquin</hi> and <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> which <hi>Navaratte</hi> reports to be made of the Sea-froth in ſome Rocks, by a kind of ſmall Sea-Birds, which reſemble Swallows, Gumme Gutte, Incenſe, Oyl, Coco, Cotton, Cinnamon, Nenuphar, which is not exactly like ours; Caſſia, Dates, and ſeveral other things, as well the growth of the Kingdom, as brought from abroad.</p>
                     <p>Every one may make and ſell Salt; fiſh and hunt, as I have declared,<note place="margin">Salt, Fiſhing, Hunting.</note> and without paying any thing to the King. It is true, that the neceſſary Policy is uſed in Fiſhing; and <hi>Oc-Pra Tainam,</hi> who receives the particular Revenues of the River, hinders thoſe ways of Fiſhing, which deſtroy too much Fiſh at once.<note place="margin">To what Sum the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Revenues amount.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has never been well paid his Revenues in lands remote from his Court. 'Tis ſaid that the ready Money that he formerly received, amounted to Twelve hundred thouſand Livres, and that what he now gets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to Six hundred thouſand Crowns, or to Two Millions. 'Tis a difficult thing to know exactly: all that I can aſſert is, that in this Country it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as a thing very conſiderable, and which ſeems Hyperbolical) that the preſent King of <hi>Siam</hi> has augmented his Revenues a Million.</p>

The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which is in the Seals, is not hollow, but in Relievo. The Seal is rub'd over with a kind of Red Ink, and is printed on the Paper with the Hand.

                     <p>After ſeveral remarks, which I have made, it ſeems to me,<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Maha-Oharat.</hi>
                        </note> that whatever is done in the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Name has no Power, if it is not done at the place where this King actually reſides. Certain reaſons have hindered, why they have not certainly inform'd me thereof. However, it is certain, that for the reaſon which I have alledged, or for ſome other, there is at <hi>Siam</hi> as it were a Vice-Roy, who repreſents the King, and performs the Regal Functions in the King's Abſence; as when this Prince is at War. This Officer is called <hi>Maha-Oharat,</hi> as it was given me in writing, or <hi>Ommarat,</hi> according to the Abbot <hi>de Choiſy,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gervaiſe.</hi> And the Abbot <hi>de Choiſy</hi> adds, that the <hi>Maha Omarat</hi> has a right of ſitting down in the King's Preſence, a Circumſtance which ſome have informed me to be peculiar to another Officer, of whom I ſhall ſpeak in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.

This Prince's Palace has its Officers within, and its Officers without; but ſo different in dignity, that an <hi>Oc-Meuing</hi> within commands all the <hi>Oc-ya</hi> without. They call Officers within, not only thoſe which lodge always in the Palace, but thoſe whoſe functions are exerciſed in the Palace: And they call Officers without the Palace, not all the Officers of the Kingdom, which have no Function in the Palace, but thoſe which having no Function in the Palace; yet have not any without which reſpects not the Service of the Palace. Thus the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Servants, which they call <hi>de Eſcalera arriba,</hi> and others which they call <hi>de Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera abaxo,</hi> that is to ſay Servants at the top of the Stairs, or which may go up the Stairs to their Maſter, and to thoſe to whom their Maſter ſends them, and others who wait always at the bottom of the Stairs.</p>

All that the inward Cloſe includes, <hi>viz.</hi> the King's Apartment, ſome Court, and ſome Garden, is called <hi>Vang</hi> in <hi>Siameſe.</hi> The whole Palace with all its Incloſures is called <hi>Praſſat,</hi> though <hi>Vliet</hi> in the Title of his Relation tranſlates the word <hi>Praſſat</hi> by that of Throne. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> neither enter into the <hi>Vang,</hi> nor depart thence without proſtrating themſelves, and they paſs not before the <hi>Praſſat.</hi> And if ſometimes the ſtream of the Water carries them, and forces them to paſs thereby, they are pelted with ſhowers of Peaſe, which the King's Servants ſhoot over them with Trunks.

Their Employment is hereditary, like all the reſt of the Kingdom; and the ancient Law imports that they ought not to exceed ſix hundred: But this muſt doubtleſs be underſtood that there ought to be no more than ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for the Palace: for there muſt needs be many more in the whole extent of the State; becauſe that the King, as I have ſaid elſewhere, gives thereof to a very great number of Officers.<note place="margin">A Guard of Slaves for a Show.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Prince is not contented with this Guard on days of Ceremony, as was that of the firſt Audience of the King's Ambaſſadors. On ſuch occaſions he cauſes his Slaves to be armed; and if their number is not ſufficient, the Slaves of the principal Officers are armed. He gives to them all ſome Muſlin Shirts dyed red, Muskets, or Bows, or Lances, and Pots of gilded wood on their Heads, which for this purpoſe are taken out of the Magazine: and the quantity of which, in my opinion, determines the number of theſe Soldiers of ſhow. They formed a double Rank at the reception of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>de Chaumont;</hi> and ſo ſoon as he was paſt, thoſe which he had left behind, made haſte to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the by-ways, to go to fill up the vacant places which were left for them. In our time they marched by the ſides of the Ambaſſadors, till they ſtopt up the ſpace through which they were to paſs. We alſo found part of theſe Slaves proſtrate before the little Stairs, which goes up to the Hall of Audience. Some held thoſe little uſeleſs Trumpets, which I have ſpoken of; and others had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them thoſe little Drums, which they never beat. The <hi>Meuing Tchion</hi> are the <hi>Nai</hi> of all theſe Slaves; and theſe Slaves row the <hi>Balons</hi> of the King's retinue, and are moreover employed on ſeveral works.</p>
                     <p>Anciently the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> had a <hi>Japponeſe</hi> Guard,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has no ſtanding <hi>Jap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſe</hi> Guard.</note> compoſed of ſix hundred men: but becauſe theſe ſix hundred men alone, could make the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to tremble when they pleaſed, the preſent King's Father, after having made uſe of them to invade the Throne, found out a way to rid himſelf of them, more by policy than force.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Horſe-guard is compoſed of Men from <hi>Laos,</hi>

                        </note> and another neighbouring Country, the chief City whereof is called <hi>Meen:</hi> and as the <hi>Meens</hi> and <hi>Laos</hi> do ſerve him by ſix Months, he makes this Guard as numerous as he pleaſes, and as many Horſe as he would employ therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oc-Coune Ran Patchi</hi> commands this Guard on the right hand: His Son is in <hi>France,</hi> and has for ſome years learnt the Trade of a Fountain-maker at <hi>Triannon. Oc-Coune Pipitcharatcha,</hi> or as the People ſay, <hi>Oc-Coune Petratcha,</hi> commands the half of this Guard, which ſerves on the left hand: but over theſe two Officers <hi>Oc-ya Lao</hi> commands the Guard of the <hi>Laos,</hi> and <hi>Oc-ya Meen</hi> the Guard of the <hi>Meen:</hi> and this <hi>Oc-ya Meen</hi> is a different perſon from him that proſtitutes lewd Women.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has a foreign ſtanding Horſe-guard,<note place="margin">A Foreign Horſe-Guard.</note> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an Hundred and Thirty Gentlemen: but neither they, nor the <hi>Meen,</hi> nor the <hi>Laos,</hi> do ever keep Guard in the Palace.

                     <p>This foreign Guard conſiſts, firſt in two Companies of thirty <hi>Moors</hi> each,<note place="margin">Of what it is compoſed.</note> Natives, or originally deſcended from the States of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> of an excellent Meen, but accounted Cowards.

                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſupplies this whole Guard with Arms, and with Horſes:<note place="margin">What it coſts.</note>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the White Elephant.</note>Theſe People have naturally ſo great an eſteem of Elephants, that they are perſwaded that an Animal ſo noble, ſo ſtrong, and ſo docile, can be animated only with an illuſtrious Soul, which has formerly been in the body of ſome Prince, or of ſome great Perſon: but they have yet a much higher Idea of the White Elephants. Theſe Animals are rare, and are found, ſay they, only in the Woods of <hi>Siam.</hi> They are not altogether White, but of a fleſh colour, and for this reaſon it is that <hi>Vliet</hi> in the Title of his Relation has ſaid, the White and Red Elephant. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call this colour <hi>Peuak,</hi> and I doubt not that it is this colour inclining to White and moreover ſo rare in this Animal, which has procur'd it the Veneration of thoſe People to ſuch a degree, as to perſwade them what they report thereof, that a Soul of ſome Prince is always lodged in the body of a White Elephant, whether Male or Female it matters not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Eſteem which the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameſes</hi> do make of the White colour in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</note>By the ſame reaſon of the colour, White Horſes are thoſe which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> moſt eſteem. I proceed to give a proof thereof. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> having one of his Horſes ſick, intreated M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Vincent,</hi> that Phyſician which I have frequently mentioned, to preſcribe him ſome Remedy. And to perſwade him to it (for he well knew that the <hi>European</hi> Phyſicians debaſed not themſelves to meddle with Beaſts) he acquainted him that the Horſe was <hi>Mogol</hi> (that is to ſay White) of four races by Sire and Dam, without any mixture of <hi>Indian</hi> blood; and that had it not been for this conſideration he would not have made him this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The <hi>Indians</hi> call the White, <hi>Mogols,</hi> which they diſtinguiſh into <hi>Mogols</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Mogols</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> Therefore whence ſoever this reſpect is for the White colour, as well in Men as in Beaſts, I could diſcover no other reaſon at <hi>Siam,</hi> than that of the veneration which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have for the White Elephants. Next to the White they moſt eſteem thoſe which are quite Black, becauſe they are likewiſe very rare; and they Dye ſome of this colour, when they are not naturally Black enough. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> always keeps a White Elephant in his Palace, which is treated like the King of all thoſe Elephants, which this Prince maintains. That which Mr. <hi>de Chaumont</hi> ſaw in this Country, was dead, as I have ſaid, when we arrived there. There was born another as they report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1687. a few days before our departure: but this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant was ſtill in the Woods, and received no Viſit, and ſo we ſaw no White Elephant. Other Relations have informed us how this Animal is ſerved with Veſſels of Gold.</p>

                     <p>IN the <hi>Vang</hi> are ſome of thoſe ſingle Halls which I have deſcribed;<note place="margin">
                           <p>In what place of the Palace the Courtiers wait.</p>
                           <p>How the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſhows himſelf to them.</p>
                        </note> in which the Officers do meet, either for their Functions, or to make their Court, or to wait the Orders of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>The uſual place were he ſhows himſelf unto them, is the Hall, where he gave Audience to the King's Ambaſſadors; and he ſhows himſelf only through a Window, as did antiently the King of <hi>China.</hi> This Window is from a higher Chamber, which has this proſpect over the Hall, and which may be ſaid to be of the firſt Story. It is nine Foot high or thereabouts; and it was neceſſary to place three ſteps underneath, to raiſe me high enough to preſent the King's Letter to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> This Prince choſe rather to cauſe theſe three ſteps to be put, than to ſee himſelf again obliged to ſtoop, to take the King's Letter from my hand, as he had been obliged to do, to take that which Mr. <hi>de Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> deliver'd him. 'Tis evident by the Relation of Mr. <hi>de Chaumont,</hi> that he had in his hands a kind of Gold Cup, which had a very long handle of the ſame matter; to the end that he might uſe it to give the King's Letter to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> He did it, but he would not take this Cup by the handle to raiſe the Letter; ſo that it was neceſſary that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſhould ſtoop out of the Window to receive it. 'Tis with the ſame Cup, that the Officers of this Prince deliver him every thing that he receives from their hands. At the two Corners of the Hall which are at the ſides of this Window, are two doors about the heighth of the Windows, and two pair of very narrow Stairs to aſcend. For the Furniture there is only three <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella's,</hi> one before the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with nine rounds, and two with ſeven rounds on both ſides of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella</hi> is in this Country as the <hi>Daiz</hi> or Canopy is in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis in this Hall that the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Officers, which if you pleaſe,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Pages.</note> may be named from his Chamber, or rather his Anti-chamber, do expect his Orders. He has Forty four young men, the oldeſt of which hardly exceeds twenty five years of Age: the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call them <hi>Mahatlek,</hi> the <hi>Europeans</hi> have called them <hi>Pages.</hi> Theſe Forty four Pages therefore are divided into four Bands, each conſiſting of eleven: the two firſt are on the right hand, and do proſtrare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Hall at the King's right hand; the two others are on the left hand, and do proſtrate themſelves on the left hand. This Prince gives them every one a Name and a Sabre; and they carry his Orders to the Pages without, which are numerous, and which have no Name, that is impoſed on them by the King. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call them <hi>Caloang,</hi> and 'tis theſe <hi>Caloangs</hi> that the King ordinarily ſends into the Provinces upon Commiſſions, whether ordinary, or extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this the Forty four Pages within have their Functions regulated: Some,<note place="margin">Their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> for example, do ſerve Betel to the King, others take care of his Arms, others do keep his Books, and when he pleaſes they read in his preſence.</p>
                     <p>This Prince is curious to the higheſt degree.<note place="margin">How the King of <hi>Siam</hi> loves Reading.</note> He cauſed <hi>Q.

                        <hi>Poland,</hi> there was any other Elective State in <hi>Europe?</hi> And I heard him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word <hi>Polonia,</hi> of which I had not ſpoken to him. Some have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me that he has frequently aſſerted, that the Art of Ruling is not inſpired, and that with great Experience and Reading he perceived that he was not yet perfect in underſtanding it. But he deſign'd principally to ſtudy it from the Hiſtory of the King: he is deſirous of all the News from <hi>France;</hi> and ſo ſoon as his Ambaſſadors were arrived, he retain'd the third with him, until he had read their Relation to him from one end to the other.</p>

They bear only the Title of <hi>Oc-Meuing,</hi> or of <hi>Pra-Meuing: Meuing Vai, Meuing Sarapet, Meuing Semeungtchai, Meuingſii.</hi> The Sabres and Poniards which the King gives them are adorned with ſome precious Stones. All four are very conſiderable <hi>Nai,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great many ſubaltern Officers under them; and though they have only the Title of <hi>Meuing,</hi> they ceaſe not to be Officers in chief. The <hi>Pa-ya,</hi> the <hi>Oc-ya,</hi> the <hi>Oc-pra,</hi> and the other Titles are not always ſubordinate to them, only the one muſt command more perſons than the other.

                        </note>Whilſt the Ambaſſadors were at Audience, there was in one place an Officer, whom we perceived not, who alone, as they informed me, has the Priviledge of not proſtrating himſelf before the King his Maſter; and this renders his Office very honourable. I forgot to write down his Title in my Memoirs. He always has his Eyes fixed upon this Prince, to receive his Orders, which he underſtands by certain Signs, and which he ſignifies by Signs to the other Officers which are without the Hall. Thus when the Audience was ended, I wou'd ſay when the King had done ſpeaking to us, this Prince, in that ſilence which is profound, gave ſome Signal, to which we gave no heed; and immediately at the bottom of the Hall, and in an high place, which is not viſible, was heard a tinkling Noiſe, like that of a Timbrel. This Noiſe was accompany'd with a Blow, which was ever and anon ſtruck on a Drum, which is hung up under a Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe without the Hall, and which for being very great, renders its ſound grave and Majeſtie; it is cover'd with an Elephant's Skin: yet no perſon made any motion, till that the King, whoſe Chair an inviſible hand did by little and little draw back, removed himſelf from the window, and cloſed the Shutters thereof; and then the Noiſe of the tinkling and of the great Drum ceaſed.</p>

They make his Bed, and dreſs his Meat; they cloath him, and wait on him at Table: but none but himſelf touches his Head when he is attir'd, nor puts any thing over his Head. The Pourveyors carry the Proviſions to the Eunuchs, and they give them to the Women; and ſhe which plays the Cook, uſes Salt and Spices only by weight, thereby never to put in more nor leſs: A practice, which, in my opinion, is only a Rule of the Phyſicians, by reaſon of the King's unhealthy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and not an ancient cuſtom of the Palace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:98501:61"/>The Women do never ſtir out but with the King,<note place="margin">Of the late Queen his Wife and his Siſter.</note> nor the Eunuchs without expreſs Order. 'Tis reported that he has eight or ten Eunuchs only, as well white as black. The late Queen, who was both his Wife and his Siſter, was called <hi>Nang Achamahiſii.</hi> It is not eaſie to know the King's Name, they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſuperſtitiouſly conceal it, for fear leſt any Enchantment ſhould be made on his Name. And others report, that their Kings have no Name till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, and that it is their Succeſſor which names them, and this would be more certain againſt the pretended Sorceries.</p>
                     <p>Of Queen <hi>Achamahiſii</hi> is born, as I have related in the other Part, the Princeſs,<note place="margin">Of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his only Daughter.</note> the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s only Daughter, who now has the Rank and Houſe of a Queen. The King's other Wives (which in general are called <hi>Tchaou Vang,</hi> becauſe that the word <hi>Tchaou,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Lord,</hi> ſignifies likewiſe <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>) do render Obedience to her, and reſpect her as their Soveraign. They are ſubject to her Juſtice, as well as the Women and Eunuchs which ſerve them; becauſe that not being able to ſtir out, to go plead elſewhere, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the Queen ſhould judge them, and cauſe them to be chaſtiſed, to keep them in peace. This is thus practiſed in all the Courts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> but it is not true neither at <hi>Siam,</hi> nor perhaps in any part of the Eaſt, that the Queen has any Province to govern. 'Tis eaſie alſo to comprehend, that if the King loves any of his Ladies more than the reſt, he cauſes her to remove from the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and harſh Uſage of the Queen.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Siam</hi> they continually take Ladies for the ſervice of the <hi>Vang,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> takes the Daughters of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for his Palace, when he pleaſes.</note> or to be Concubines to the King, if this Prince makes uſe thereof. But the <hi>Siameſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their Daughters only by force, becauſe it is never to ſee them again; and they redeem them ſo long as they can for Money. So that this becomes a kind of Extortion, for they deſignedly take a great many Virgins meerly to reſtore them to their Parents, who redeem them.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> has few Miſtreſſes, that is to ſay eight or ten in all,<note place="margin">He has few Miniſtreſſes.</note> not out of Continency, but Parſimony. I have already declared, that to have a great many Wives, is in this Country rather Magnificence, than Debauchery. Wherefore they are very much ſurprized to hear that ſo great a King as ours has no more than one Wife, that he had no Elephants, and that his Lands bear no Rice; as we might be, when it was told us that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has no Horſes, nor ſtanding Forces, and that his Country bears no Corn nor Grapes, altho' all the Relations do ſo highly extol the Riches and Power of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </p>

She is conceal'd from all the reſt of the People; and when ſhe goes out either on an Elephant, or in a Balon, it is in a Chair made up with Curtains, which permit her to ſee what ſhe pleaſes, and do prevent her being ſeen: And Reſpect commands, that if they cannot avoid her, they ſhould turn their back to her, by proſtrating themſelves when ſhe paſſes along.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this ſhe has her Magazine, her Ships, and her Treaſures.<note place="margin">Her Magazine and her Ships.</note> She exerciſes Commerce; and when we arrived in this Country, the Princeſs, whom I have reported to be treated like a Queen, was exceedingly embroiled with the King her Father, becauſe that he reſerved to himſelf alone almoſt all the Foreign Trade, and that thereby ſhe found herſelf deprived thereof, contrary to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of the Kingdom.</p>

The Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contribute to render the Royal Succeſſion uncertain, becauſe that inſtead of chuſing for their Succeſſor the eldeſt Son of the Queen, they moſt frequently follow the Inclination which they have for the Son of ſome one of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines with whom they were enamour'd.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Hours of Council.</note>THe common uſage of the Court of <hi>Siam</hi> is to hold a Council twice a day; about Ten a clock in the Morning, and about Ten in the Evening, reckoning the hours after our faſhion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The diviſion of the day and night accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes.</hi>
                        </note>As for them, they divide the day into Twelve hours, from the Morning to the Night: The Hours they call <hi>Mong:</hi> they reckon them like us, and give them not a particular name to each, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do. As for the Night, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into four Watches, which they call <hi>Tgiam,</hi> and it is always broad Day at the end of the Fourth. The <hi>Latins, Greeks, Jews,</hi> and other people have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Day and Night, after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Their Clock.</note>The People of <hi>Siam</hi> have no Clock; but as the Days are almoſt equal there all the Year, it is eaſie for them to know what Hour it is, by the ſight of the Sun. In the King's Palace they uſe a kind of Water-Clock: 'Tis a thin Copper Cup, at the bottom of which they do make an almoſt imperceptible hole. They put it quite empty upon the water: which by little and little enters therein through the hole; and when the Cup is full enough to ſink down, this is one of the hours, or a twelfth part of the day. They meaſure the Watches of the Night by ſuch a like method, and they make a Noiſe on Copper Baſons when the Watch is ended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98501:62"/>I have related how Cauſes are determined in the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Council:<note place="margin">How the King of <hi>Siam</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines Affairs in his Council, and how he terminates them.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State are there examined, and decided almoſt after the ſame manner. That Councellor to whom this Prince has committed a buſineſs, makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof, which conſiſts in reading it, and then proceeds to the conſultative Opinions; and hitherto the King's Preſence is not neceſſary. When he is come he hears the report, which is read to him concerning the former Conſult, he reſumes all the advices, confutes thoſe which he approves not, and then decides. But if the Affair ſeems to him to merit a more mature deliberation, he makes no deciſion: but after having propoſed his difficulties, he commits the examination thereof to ſome of his Council, whom he purpoſely appoints; and principally to thoſe who were of a different Opinion from his. They, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having again conſulted together, do cauſe the report of their new Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made by one of them, in a full Council, and before the King; and hereupon this Prince conſummates his Determination. Yet ſometimes, but very rarely, and in affairs of a cerrain Nature, he will conſult the principal <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras,</hi> which are the Superiors of the <hi>Talapoins;</hi> whoſe credit in other matters he depreſſes as much as he can, though in appearance he honors them exceedingly. In a word, there is ſuch a ſort of affairs, wherein he will call the Officers of the Provinces: but on all occaſions, and in all affairs, he decides when he pleaſes; and he is never conſtrained to either ask advice of any perſon, or to follow any other advice than his own.</p>
                     <p>He oftentimes puniſhes ill Advice, or recompences good.<note place="margin">He puniſhes bad Counſels, and recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces good.</note> I ſay good or bad according to his ſenſe, for he alone is the Judge thereof. Thus his Miniſters do much more apply themſelves to divine his ſentiments, than to declare him theirs, and they miſunderſtand him, by reaſon he alſo endeavours to conceal his Opinion from them.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the affair on which he conſults them,<note place="margin">
                           <p>Sometimes he conſults about Affairs invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by way of Exerciſe.</p>
                           <p>He examines his Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations.</p>
                           <p>A Law againſt the Ambition of the Great Men.</p>
                        </note> is not always a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; 'tis ſometimes a queſtion, which he propounds to them by way of exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>He likewiſe has a cuſtom of examining his Officers about the <hi>Pra-Tam-Ra,</hi> which is that Book, which I have ſaid contains all their Duties; and cauſes ſuch to be chaſtized with the Baſtinado, who anſwer not very exactly; even as a Father chaſtizes his Children in inſtructing them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an ancient Law of the State eſtabliſhed for the ſecurity of the King, whoſe Authority is naturally almoſt unarmed, that the Courtiers ſhould not render him any viſit without his expreſs leave, and only at Weddings and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and that when they meet, they ſhould ſpeak with a loud voice, and in the preſence of a third perſon: but if the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> be unactive, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, not any Law ſecures them. At preſent the Courtiers may appear again at the Academy of Sports, where the great number ſeems to take away all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Caballings.</p>
                     <p>The Trade of an Informer, ſo deteſted in all places where men are born free,<note place="margin">The Trade of an Informer commanded at <hi>Siam</hi> by the Law.</note>
is commanded to every perſon at <hi>Siam,</hi> under pain of death for the leaſt things; and ſo whatever is known by two Witneſſes, is almoſt infallibly related to the King: becauſe that every one haſtens to give information thereof, for fear of being herein prevented by his Companion, and remain guilty of Silence.<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siams</hi> Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preſent King of <hi>Siam</hi> relies not in an important affair upon the ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him to whom he has committed it; but neither does he rely alſo on the report of a ſingle Informer. He has a number of ſecret Spies, whom he ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately interrogates; and he ſometimes ſends more than one to interrogate thoſe who have acted in the affair, whereof he would be informed.</p>
                     <p>And yet it is eaſie for him to be deceived;<note place="margin">Why they are frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</note> for throughout the Country eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Informer is a diſhoneſt man, and every diſhoneſt man is an Infidel. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Flattery is ſo great in <hi>India,</hi> that it has perſuaded the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, that if it is their intereſt to be informed, it is their dignity to hear nothing that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. As for example, they will not tell the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> that he wants Slaves or Vaſſals, for any enterprize he would go about. They will not tell him that they cannot perform his Commands: but they execute them ill, and when the miſchief appears, they will excuſe it by ſome defect. They will tell
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98501:63"/>
him ill news quite otherwiſe than it is; to the end that the truth reaching his Ears only by degrees, may vex him leſs, and that it might be eaſier to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him at ſeveral times. They will not counſel him a bad thing; but will ſo inſinuate it, that he may think himſelf the Author, and only take to himſelf the bad ſucceſs. And then they will not tell him that he muſt alter a thing that he has done amiſs; but they will perſuade him to do it better ſome other way, which will only be a pretence: and in the new project they will ſuppreſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting him, what they deſigned to reform, and will put in the place what they deſigned to eſtabliſh. I my ſelf have ſeen part of what I relate, and and they have aſſured me the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siams</hi> rigorous Juſtice.</note>Now ſuch like Artifices are always very perilous; they offend the preſent King in nothing without being puniſh'd. Being ſevere to extream rigour, he puts to death whom he pleaſes without any formality of Juſtice, and by the hand of whom he pleaſes, and in his own Preſence. And ſometimes the Accuſer with the Criminal, the Innocent with the Calumniator: for when the proofs remain doubtful, he, as I have ſaid, expoſes both parties to the Tygers.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults over the dead body.</note>After the Execution he inſults over the dead body with ſome words, which are a leſſon to the living; as for example, after having made him who had robb'd his Magazine, to ſwallow ſome melted Silver, he ſays to the dead body, Miſerable wretch, thou haſt robb'd me of Ten Pieces of Silver, and Three Ounces on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſufficient to take away thy life. Then he complains that they with-held him not in his Anger; either that he indeed repents ſometimes of his precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Cruelties, or that he would make believe that he is cruel only in the firſt Tranſport.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Various Puniſhments of the Court of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note>Sometimes he expoſes a Criminal to an enraged Bull, and the Criminal is armed with a hollow ſtick, conſequently proper to cauſe fear, but not to wound, with which he defends himſelf ſome time. At other times he will give the Criminal to Elephants, ſometimes to be trampled under foot and ſlain, ſometimes to be toſſed without killing: for they affirm that the Elephants are docible to that degree, and that if a Man is only to be toſſed, they throw him one to the other, and receive him on their Trunck, and on their Teeth, without letting him fall on the ground. I have not ſeen it, but I cannot doubt of the manner which they have aſſured me.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have reſpect to the Crimes.</note>But the Ordinary Chaſtiſements are thoſe, which have ſome relation to the Nature of the Crimes. As for example, Extortion excerciſed on the People, and a Robbery committed on the Prince's Money, will be puniſhed by the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Gold or Silver melted: Lying, or a Secret revealed, will be puniſhed by Sowing up the Mouth. They will ſlit it to puniſh Silence, where it is not to be kept. Any Fault in the execution of Orders, will be Chaſtiſed by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head, as to puniſh the Memory. To prick the Head, is to cut it with the edge of a Sabre: but to manage it ſecurely, and not to make too great wounds, they hold it with one hand by the Back, and not by the Handle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sword and the Cudgel.</note>The puniſhment of the Glave or Sword is not executed only by cutting the Head off, but by cutting a man through the middle of the Body: And the Cudgel is ſometimes alſo a puniſhment of death. But when the Chaſtiſement of the Cudgel ought not to extend to death, it ceaſes not to be very rigorous, and frequently to cauſe the loſs of all knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>If the matter is to put a Prince to death in form, as it may happen, or when a King would rid himſelf of ſome of his Relations, or when an Uſurper would extinquiſh the race, from which he has raviſh'd the Crown, they make it a piece of Religion not to ſhed the Royal blood: but they will make him to die with hunger, and ſometimes with a lingering hunger, by daily ſubſtracting from him ſomething of his food; or they will ſtifle him with Rich Stuffs; or rather they will ſtretch him on Scarlet, which they mightily eſteem, becauſe the Wool is rare, and dear; and there they will thruſt into his Stomach a billet of Saunders Wood. This Wood is odoriferous, and highly eſteem'd. There are three ſorts; the white is better than the yellow, and both do grow only in the Iſles of <hi>Solor</hi> and <hi>Timor,</hi> to the Eaſt of <hi>Java.</hi> The red is eſteemed the leaſt of all, and it grows in ſeveral places.</p>

                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98501:63"/>The Kings of <hi>Aſia</hi> do place their whole ſecurity in rendering themſelves formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and from time out of mind they have had no other Policy:<note place="margin">The extreme diſtruſt of the Kings of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </note> whether that a long Experience has evinced that theſe People are uncapable of Love for their Soveraign; or that theſe Kings would not be adviſed that the more they are fear'd, the more they have to fear. However it be, the extream diſtruſt in which the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> do always live, appears ſufficiently in the cares which they take to prevent all ſecret Correſpondence amongſt the great Men, to keep the Gates of their Palace ſhut, and to permit no armed perſon to enter, and to diſarm their own Guards. A Gun fired, by accident or otherwiſe, ſo near the Palace that the King hears it, is a capital Crime; and the noiſe of a Piſtol be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard in the Palace, a little after the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> 'twas doubted whether the King had not with this ſhot killed one of his Brothers; becauſe that the King alone has power to ſhoot, and that moreover one of his Brethren had been ſuſpected of having medled in this Conſpiracy: and this doubt was not cleared when we left <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe Puniſhments which I have mentioned,<note place="margin">Infamous Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> they have ſome leſs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, but more infamous, as to expoſe a Man in a public place loaded with Irons, or with his Neck put into a kind of Ladder or Pillory, which is called <hi>Cangue,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Ka.</hi> The two ſides of this Ladder are about ſix foot long, and are faſtned to a Wall, or to Poſts, each at one end, with a Cord; inſomuch that the Ladder may be rais'd up, and let down, as if it was faſten'd to Pullies. In the middle of the Ladder are two Steps or Rounds, between which is the Neck of the Offender, and there are no more Rounds than theſe two. The Offender may ſit on the ground, or ſtand, when the weight of the Ladder, which bears upon his Shoulders, is not too big, as it is ſometimes; or when the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not faſtned at the four ends: for in this laſt Caſe it is planted in the Air, bearing at the ends upon Props, and then the Criminal is as it were hung by the Neck; he hardly touches the ground with the Tips of his Toes. Beſides this, they have the uſe of Stocks and Manacles.</p>
                     <p>The Criminal is ſometimes in a Ditch to be lower than the ground; and this Ditch is not always broad, but oftentimes it is extremely narrow, and the Criminal, properly ſpeaking, is buried up to the Shoulders. There, for the greater Ignominy, they give him Cuffs or Blows on the Head; or they only ſtroke the hand over his Head, Affronts eſteemed very great, eſpecially if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the hand of a Woman.</p>
                     <p>But what is herein very particular, is,<note place="margin">
                           <p>The ſhame of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laſts no longer than the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p>It is attended with Honour</p>
                        </note> that the moſt infamous Puniſhment is reproachful only as long as it laſts. He that ſuffers it to day, will re-enter to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, if the Prince thinks fit, into the moſt important Offices.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, they boaſt of the Puniſhments which they receive by Order of their King, as of his paternal care for him whom he has the goodneſs to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe. He receives Compliments and Preſents after the Baſtinado, and it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the Eaſt that Chaſtiſements do paſs for teſtimonies of Affection. We ſaw a young <hi>Mandarin</hi> ſhut up to be puniſhed, and a <hi>Frenchman</hi> offering him to go and ask his Pardon of his Superior: <hi>No,</hi> replied the <hi>Mandarin</hi> in <hi>Portugueſe, I would ſee how far his Love would reach;</hi> or as an <hi>European</hi> would have ſaid, <hi>I would ſee how far he will extend his Rigor.</hi> To be reduced from an eminent place to a lower is no Reproach, and this befel the ſecond Ambaſſador whom we ſaw here. Yet it happens alſo, that in this Country they hang themſelves in deſpair, when they ſee themſelves reduced from an high Employment to an extreme Poverty, and to the ſix Months Service due to the Prince, tho' this Fall be not ſhameful.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid in another place,<note place="margin">Others are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Puniſhments with the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals.</note> that a Father ſhares ſometimes in the puniſhment of the Son, as being bound to anſwer for the Education which he has given him. At <hi>China</hi> an Officer anſwers for the Faults of all the perſons of his Family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they pretend, that he who knows not how to govern his own Family, is not capable of any public Function. The Fear therefore, which particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have of ſeeing their Families turned out of the Employments, which do make the Splendor and Support thereof, renders them all wiſe, as if they were all Magiſtrates. In like manner at <hi>Siam,</hi> and at <hi>China,</hi> an Officer is puniſhed for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98501:64"/>
the Offences of another Officer that is ſubject to his Orders, by reaſon that he is to watch over him that depends on him; and that having power to correct him, he ought to anſwer for his conduct. Thus about three years ſince we ſaw at <hi>Siam</hi> for three days, <hi>Oc-Pra-Simo-ho-ſot,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Brame,</hi> who is now in the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Council of State, expoſed to the <hi>Cangue</hi> with the head of a Malefactor, which they had put to Death, hung about his Neck; without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed of having had any other hand in the crime of him, whoſe head was hung to his Neck, than too great Negligence in watching over a Man that was ſubject to him. After this 'tis no wonder in my opinion, that the Baſtinado ſhould be ſo frequent at <hi>Siam.</hi> Sometimes there may be ſeen ſeveral Officers at the <hi>Cangue,</hi> diſpoſed in a Circle; and in the midſt of them will be the head of a man, which they have put to death; and this head will hang by ſeveral ſtrings from the Neck of every one of theſe Officers.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for a Crime is puniſhed.</note>The worſt is, that the leaſt appearance of guilt renders an action criminal: To be accuſed is almoſt ſufficient to be culpable. An action in it ſelf innocent becomes bad, ſo ſoon as any one thinks to make a Crime thereof. And from thence proceed the ſo frequent diſgraces of the principal Officers. They know not how, for inſtance, to reckon up all the <hi>Barcalons</hi> that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has had ſince he reigned.</p>

The Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> do maim them, in ſeveral ways, when they can: they take away or debilitate their ſight by fire; they render them impotent by diſlocation of Members, or ſottiſh by Drinks, ſecuring themſelves and their Children againſt the Enterprizes of their Brethren, only by rendring them incapable of reigning: he that now reigns has not treated his better. This Prince will not therefore envy our King, the ſweetneſs of being beloved by his Subjects, and the Glory of being dreaded by his Enemies. The Idea of a great King is not at <hi>Siam,</hi> that he ſhould render himſelf terrible to his Neighbours, provided he be ſo to his Subjects.</p>

Ambition in this Country leads to Slavery: Liberty, and the other Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life are for the vulgar Conditions. The more one is unknown to the Prince, and the further from him, the greater Eaſe he enjoys; and for this reaſon the Employments of the Provinces are there conſidered, as a Recompence of the Services done in the Palace.</p>

And though the Miniſters and all the other Officers, do employ all their artifices to render theſe ways of complaints ineffectual, whereby one may attack them all, yet all complaints are dangerous, and ſometimes it is the ſlighteſt which hurts, and which ſubverts the beſt eſtabliſhed favour. Theſe examples, which very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen, do edifie the People; and if the preſent King had not too far extended his exactions without any real neceſſity, his Government would as much pleaſe the Populace, as it is terrible to the Nobles.</p>

They find not in any perſon, or at moſt in a ſmall number of Domeſticks, that Fidelity or Love which we have for our Kings. The People which poſſeſs nothing in property, and which do reckon only upon what they have buried in the ground, as they have no ſolid eſtabliſhment in their Country, ſo they have no obligation thereto. Being reſolved to bear the ſame Yoke under any Prince whatever, and

having the aſſurance of not being able to bear a heavier, they concern not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Fortune of their Prince: and experience evinces that upon the leaſt trouble they let the Crown go, to whom Force or Policy will give it. A <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe,</hi> a <hi>Chineſe,</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> will eaſily die to exert a particular Hatred, or to avoid a miſerable Life, or a too cruel Death: but to die for their Prince and their Country, is not a Vertue in their practice. Amongſt them are not found the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motives, by which our People animate themſelves to a vigorous Defence. They have no Inheritance to loſe, and Liberty is oftentimes more burdenſom to them than Servitude. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> which the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> has taken in war, will live peaceable in <hi>Pegu,</hi> at Twenty miles diſtant from the Frontiers of <hi>Siam,</hi> and they will there cultivate the Lands which the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> has given them, no remembrance of their Country making them to hate their new Servitude.

                        </gap>; and whether the Adoption of Heaven has not paſſed from the King to the Subject. Their Hiſtories are all full of theſe examples: and that of <hi>China,</hi> which Father <hi>Martinius</hi> has given us, is curious in the ratiociniations, by which the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> I mean the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Philoſophers, are often perſwaded that they followed the Inclination of Heaven in changing their Soveraign, and ſometimes in preferring a High-way-man before their Lawful Prince.</p>
                     <p>But beſides that the deſpotick Authority is almoſt deſtitute of defence,<note place="margin">Theſe Princes do oftentimes loſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> it is moreover rather uſurped by him that poſſeſſes it, in that the exerciſe thereof is leſs communicated. Whoever takes upon him the Spirit or Perſon of a Prince, has almoſt nothing more to do to diſpoſſeſs the Prince; becauſe that the exerciſe of the Authority being too much reunited in the Prince, there is none beſides him that prohibits it in caſe of need. Thus is it not lawful for a King to be a Minor, or too eaſie to let himſelf be governed. The Scepter of this Country ſoon falls from hands that need a ſupport to ſuſtain it. On the contrary, in Kingdoms where ſeveral permanent bodies of Magiſtracy divide the Splendor and the Exerciſe of the Royal Authority, theſe ſame bodies do preſerve it entire for the King, who imparts it to them; becauſe they deliver not to the Uſurper that part which is in their hands, and which alone ſuffices to ſave that which the King himſelf knows not how to keep.</p>
                     <p>In the ancient Rebellions of <hi>China</hi> it appears,<note place="margin">The peril in re-uniting all the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Seal.</note> that he who ſeized on the Royal Seal, preſently rendered himſelf Maſter of all; becauſe that the people obeyed the Orders where the Seal appear'd, without informing themſelves in whoſe hands the Seal was. And the Jealouſie which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> has of his, that I have ſaid he intruſts with no perſon, perſuades me that it is the ſame in his Country. The danger therefore to theſe Princes is in that wherein they place their ſecurity. Their Policy requires that their whole Authority ſhould be in their Seal, to exerciſe it more entire themſelves alone: And this Policy as much expoſes their Authority, as their Seal is eaſie to loſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſame danger is found in a great Treaſure,<note place="margin">
                           <p>A publick Treaſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and what are the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

In a great Treaſure all the Forces of the State reunite themſelves, and he that ſeizes on the Treaſure, ſeizes on the State. So that beſides a Treaſures ruining the People, on whom it is levied, it frequently ſerves againſt thoſe that accumulate it; and this likewiſe draws the diſſipation thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Government has therefore all the defects of the Deſpotick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It renders the Prince and his Subjects equally uncertain: It betrays the Royal Authority, and delivers it up entire, under pretence of putting the more entire Management thereof into the hands of a ſingle perſon; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it deprives it of its natural defence, by ſeparating the whole Intereſt of the

Subjects from that of the Prince and State. Having therefore related how the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> do treat their Subjects, it remains to ſhow how they treat, as well with foreign Princes by Embaſſies, as with the foreign Nations which are fled to <hi>Siam.</hi>

                        </note>AN Ambaſſador throughout the Eaſt is no other than a Kings Meſſenger: he repreſents not his Maſter. They honour him little, in compariſon of the reſpects which are render'd to the Letters of Credence whereof he is Bearer. Mr. <hi>de Chaumont,</hi> tho an Ambaſſador extraordinary, never had a <hi>Balon</hi> of the Body, not on the very day of his entrance; and it was in a <hi>Balon</hi> of the Body that the Kings Letter was put, which he had to deliver to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> This <hi>Balon</hi> had four <hi>

Thus the Orientals make no difference between an Ambaſſador and an Envoy: And they underſtand not Ambaſſadors, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Envoys, nor Reſidents; becauſe they ſend no perſon to reſide at a foreign Court, but there to diſpatch a buſineſs, and return.</p>

                     <p>The Majeſty of the Prince reſides principally in the Metropolis, 'tis there that the Solemn Audiences are given; out of this City every Audience is accounted private, and without Ceremony. The whole Guard, as well the Ordinary, as that of Oſtentation, was put in Arms for the Audience at <hi>Siam:</hi> the Elephants and the Horſes appear'd with their beſt Harneſs, and in great number, on the Entry of the King's Envoys, and there was almoſt nothing of all this for the Audiences at <hi>Louvo.</hi> At <hi>Siam</hi> the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella,</hi> which was before the King's win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, had nine Rounds, and the two which were at the ſide had ſeven each. At <hi>Louvo</hi> the King had no <hi>

So that tho' this Prince was as high at <hi>Louvo</hi> as at <hi>Siam,</hi> yet he was at <hi>Louvo</hi> in the Hall of Audience; whereas at <hi>Siam</hi> he was in another Room, which had a Proſpect into the Hall. Moreover, the Gate of the Hall at <hi>Louvo</hi> was large, and in the middle of the Tower, that is to ſay oppoſite to the King; whereas at <hi>Siam</hi> the door was low and ſtrait, and almoſt at the corner of the Hall: differences, which have all their reaſons in this Country, where the leaſt things are meaſured and performed with diligence. At the Audience at <hi>Siam</hi> there were 50 Mandarins proſtrate in the Hall, 25 on each ſide, in five Ranks, each conſiſting of five. At the Audiences at <hi>Louvo</hi> there were no more than 32, 16 on each ſide, in four Ranks, of four in a Rank. The Audience of Reception, where the Letter of Credence is delivered, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given in the chief City, and with all the magnificence imaginable, in reſpect to the Letter of Credence: the other Audiences are given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, and with leſs Pomp, becauſe there appears no Letter from the King.</p>
                     <p>The Cuſtom in all Audiences is, that the King ſpeaks firſt,<note place="margin">What is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences.</note> and not the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador. What he ſpeaks in Audiences of Ceremony, is reduced to ſome Queſtions almoſt always the ſame; after which, he orders the Ambaſſador to addreſs himſelf to the <hi>Barcalon</hi> upon all the Propoſitions which he has to make. Harrangues pleaſe him not at all; tho' he had the goodneſs to acquaint me, upon the Compliments I had the Honour to make to him, that I was a great Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Words. We were fain to embelliſh them with Figures, and therein to uſe the Sun, Moon and Stars; Ornaments of Diſcourſe, which may pleaſe them in other things: This Prince thinks that the longer an Ambaſſador ſpeaks the firſt time, the leſs he honours him. And indeed when the Ambaſſador is only a Meſſenger, which delivers a Letter, it is natural that he has nothing to ſay which is not asked him. After the King has ſpoken to the Ambaſſador, he gives him <hi>Arek</hi> and <hi>Betel,</hi> and a Veſt, with which the Ambaſſador cloaths himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and ſometimes a Sabre, and a Chain of Gold.</p>
                     <p>This Prince gave Sabres, Chains of Gold and Veſts,<note place="margin">To Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are not Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, he gives Audience only by accident.

                     <p>In all ſorts of Buſineſs, the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſlow in concluding, by reaſon of the length of their Councils, for they never depart from their Cuſtoms. They are very phlegmatic and hypocritical. They are inſinuating in their Speeches, captious in their Writings, deceitful, to ſuch a degree as to Cheat. The praiſe which the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Wives and Concubines give him, when they would flatter him to the higheſt degree, was to tell him, not that he was an Hero, or the greateſt General in the World, but that he had always been more politic and witty, than all the Princes with whom he had to do. They engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in writing as little as they can. They will rather receive you into a Port,

The King of <hi>Siam</hi> ſays of his Subjects, that they are of the temper of Apes, who tremble ſo long as one holds the end of their Band, and who diſown their Maſter, when the Band is looſed. Examples are not rare in <hi>India</hi> of ſimple <hi>European</hi> Factors, who have baſtinado'd the Officers of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings without being puniſhed.

And ſo they will ſeem to make an high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all ſorts of Preſents, to honour the Prince which ſends them, unleſs he has received Preſents from their part with leſs demonſtrations of Eſteem. Nevertheleſs they are really concern'd only for the Profit. Before that the King's Preſents went out of our hands, ſome of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Officers came to take an exact deſcription thereof in writing, even to the counting all the Stones of every ſort which were interſpers'd in the Embroideries; and to the end that it might not ſeem that the King their Maſter took this care to prevent being robbed by his Officers, through whoſe hands the Preſents were to paſs, they pretended that this Prince was curious and impatient, and that it was neceſſary to go render him an account of what this was, and to be ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him exactly upon the leaſt things.</p>

They look upon Embaſſies as a kind of Homage; and in their Courts they retain the Foreign Miniſters as long as it is poſſible, to prolong, as much as in them lies, the Honour which they receive. Thus the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> do never ſend Ambaſſadors. The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> likewiſe ſends only to <hi>Siam,</hi> becauſe that the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Ambaſſador had demanded it, as I proceed to relate.</p>

                        </note>'TWas, as I have ſaid, the Liberty of Commerce, which had formerly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Siam</hi> a great multitude of Strangers of different Nations; who ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled there with the Liberty of living according to their Cuſtoms, and of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly exerciſing their ſeveral ways of Worſhip. Every Nation poſſeſſes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Quarter. The Quarters which are without the City, and which do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Suburbs thereof, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> do call <hi>Camp,</hi> and the <hi>Siameſes Ban.</hi> Moreover every Nation chooſes its Chief, or its <hi>Nai,</hi> as the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſpeak, and this Chief manages the Affairs of his Nation with the <hi>Mandarin,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Siam</hi> nominates for this purpoſe, and whom they call the <hi>Mandarin</hi> of this Nation. But Affairs of the leaſt importance are not determined by this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darin,</hi> they are carried to the <hi>Barcalon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Fortune of the <hi>Moors</hi> very different at <hi>Siam,</hi> at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times.</note>Amongſt the ſeveral Nations, that of the <hi>Moors</hi> has been the beſt eſtabliſhed under this Reign. It once hapned that the <hi>Barcalon</hi> was a <hi>Moor,</hi> probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King of <hi>Siam</hi> thought by this means better to eſtabliſh his Commerce, amongſt the moſt powerful of his Neighbouring Princes, who do all make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Mahumetaniſm: The principal Offices of the Court, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were then in the hands of the <hi>Moors:</hi> The King of <hi>Siam</hi> cauſed ſeveral Moſques to be erected for them at his expence, and he ſtill bears the charges of their principal Feſtival, which they celebrate for ſeveral days together, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Death of <hi>Haly,</hi> or of his Children. The <hi>Siameſes,</hi> which embraced the Religion of the <hi>Moors,</hi> had the Priviledge of being exempted from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Service: But the <hi>Barcalon Moor</hi> ſoon experienced the Inconſtancy of the Fortunes of <hi>Siam,</hi> he fell into Diſgrace, and the Credit of thoſe of his Nation fell afterwards into Decay. The conſiderable Offices and Employments were taken away from them, and the <hi>Siameſes</hi> which were turned Mahumetans, were forc'd to pay in ready Money for the ſix Months Service, from which they had been exempted. Nevertheleſs their Moſques are remaining to them, as well as the publick Protection which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> gives to their Religion, as to all foreign Religions. There are therefore three or four Thouſand <hi>Moors</hi> at <hi>Siam,</hi> as many <hi>Portugueſes</hi> born in <hi>India,</hi> and as many <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and perhaps as many <hi>Malays,</hi> beſides what there is of other Nations.</p>

The King his Father had heretofore done the ſame thing, and perhaps it is the Policy of <hi>Siam</hi> to do it thus from time to time; otherwiſe it is certain that they have almoſt always left the Trade free, and that it has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently flouriſhed at <hi>Siam. Ferdinand Mendez Pinto</hi> reports, that in his time there were annually above a thouſand foreign Ships; whereas at preſent there goes no more than two or three <hi>Dutch</hi> Barks.</p>

                        </note>Commerce requires a certain liberty: no perſon can reſolve to go to <hi>Siam,</hi> neceſſarily to ſell unto the King what is carry'd thither, and to buy of him alone what one would carry thence, when this was not the product of the Kingdom. For though there were ſeveral foreign Ships together at <hi>Siam,</hi> the Trade was not permitted from one Ship to the other, nor with the Inhabitants of the Country, Natives or Foreigners, till that the King, under the pretence of a preference due to his Royal dignity, had purchaſed what was beſt in the Ships, and at his own rate, to ſell it afterwards as he pleaſed: becauſe that when the ſeaſon for the departure of the Ships preſſes on, the Merchants chooſe rather to ſell to great loſs, and dearly to buy a new Cargo, than to wait at <hi>Siam</hi> a new ſeaſon to depart, without hopes of making a better Trade.</p>

encompaſt with an Incloſure of Bambou. In the middle of the ground ſtands the Temple, as in the place eſteemed the moſt honourable in their Encampments; and at the corners of this ground, and along the Bambou Incloſure, are ranged the Cells of the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> like the Tents of an Army; and ſometimes the Rows thereof are double, or triple: Theſe Cells are little ſingle Houſes, erected on Piles, and that of the Superior is after the ſame manner, but a little larger and higher than the reſt. The Pyramids ſtand near and quite round the Temple: and the ground which the Temple and the Pyramids take up, beſides its being higher, is incloſed between four Walls: but from theſe Walls to the Cells there likewiſe remains a great void piece of Ground, which is as it were the Court of the Convent. Sometimes theſe Walls are all bare, and ſerve only as an Incloſure to the ground, which the Temple and the Pyramids take up: Sometimes along theſe Walls there are covered Galleries of the Figure of thoſe, which in our Religious Houſes we call the Cloyſter; and on a counterwall breaſt high, which runs along theſe Galleries, they place in a Train, and cloſe together, a great number of Idols ſometimes gilded.</p>

There are not <hi>Talapoineſſes</hi> in all the Convents: but in thoſe where any are, their Cells run along one of the ſides of the Bambou Incloſure, which I have mentioned, without being otherwiſe ſeparated from thoſe of the <hi>Talapoins.</hi>

Their Faſting is to eat nothing from Noon, unleſs they may chew <hi>Betel:</hi> but when they do not faſt, they only eat Fruit in the Afternoon.

The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have cited the example of a <hi>Talapoin,</hi> whom they pretend to have faſted an hundred and ſeven days, without eating any thing But when I ſounded their opinion thereon, I found that they attributed this Faſt to Magick; and to prove it to me, they added, that it was eaſie to live on the Graſs of the Fields; provided they breathed thereon, and utter'd certain words, which they underſtood not, or which they would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, or which they ſaid that others underſtood.</p>
                     <p>After the Rice-Harveſt the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do go for three Weeks to watch in the Nights in the middle of the Fields,<note place="margin">The Watch of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> in the Fields; and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem which the People makes thereof.</note> under ſmall Huts of branches of Leaves ranged ſquare; and in the day they return to viſit the Temple, and to ſleep in their Cells. The Hut of the Superior ſtands in the middle of the others, and higher. They make no Fire in the Night to ſcare away the wild Beaſts, as all thoſe that travel in the Woods of this Country us'd to do, and as was done round the <hi>Tabanques</hi> wherein we lodged: So that the People look upon it as a Miracle, that the <hi>Talapoins</hi> are not devoured; and I know not what precaution they uſe, except that of encloſing themſelves in a Park of <hi>Bambou.</hi> But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they choſe places little expoſed, remote from the Woods, and where the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Beaſts cannot come with Hunger, but after having found a great deal of Food, for it is the ſeaſon wherein there is plenty of Forage on the ground. The People admire alſo the ſecurity, in which the <hi>Talapoins</hi> of the Woods do live: For they have neither Convent nor Temple to retire into. They think that the Tygers, Elephants, and Rhinoceros do reſpect them, and lick their hands and feet, when they find any one aſleep: but theſe may make a Fire of <hi>Bambou,</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98501:70"/>
to defend themſelves from theſe Animals, they may lie in the cloſeſt Thickets; and moreover, though the people ſhould find the remains of ſome man devoured, it would never be preſumed he was a <hi>Talapoin;</hi> and when they could not doubt thereof, they would preſume that this <hi>Talapoin</hi> had been wicked, and would not ceaſe to believe that the Beaſts reſpect the good. And it muſt needs be that the Woods are not ſo dangerous as they report, ſeeing that ſo many Families do ſeek Sanctuary there againſt the Government.</p>

Their Habit conſiſts of four pieces. The firſt which they call <hi>Angſa,</hi> is a kind of Shoulder Belt of yellow Linnen, five or ſix Inches broad; they wear it on their left Shoulder, and button it with a ſingle button on the right Hip; and it deſcends not lower than the Hip. Over this Belt they put another great yellow cloath, which is called the <hi>Pagne</hi> of the <hi>Talapoin,</hi> and which they call <hi>Pa Schivon,</hi> or the Cloth of ſeveral pieces, becauſe it ought to be patched in ſeveral places. 'Tis a kind of Scapulary, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches down to the ground behind and before; and which covering only the left Shoulder returns to the right Hip, and leaves the two Arms and all the right Shoulder free. Over the <hi>Pa Schivon</hi> is the <hi>Pa Pat.</hi> 'Tis another cloth four or five Inches broad which they do likewiſe put over the left Shoulder, but like a Hood; it deſcends to the Navel before, and as much behind as before.

The People abſtain alſo on theſe days from going a Fiſhing, not that Fiſhing is a work, for they abſtain not from any other Labor, but becauſe that, in my opinion, they eſteem not Fiſhing wholly innocent, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel. And in fine, the People on theſe days do carry unto the Convents ſome Alms, which conſiſt in Money, Fruits, Pagnes, or Cattle. If the Cattle are dead, the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do eat them: if they are alive, they let them live and die about the Temple; and they eat them only when they die of themſelves.

                     <p>The People voluntarily aſſiſt at theſe Feſtivals, and make a ſhow with their new Cloaths. One of their greateſt Charities is to give Liberty to ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which they buy of thoſe that have taken them in the Fields. What they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98501:70"/>
give to the Idol, they offer not immediately to the Idol, but to the <hi>Talapoins;</hi> and they preſent it to the Idol, either by holding it in their hand before the Idol, or by laying it upon the Altar; and in a little time after they take it away, and convert it to their own uſes. Sometimes the People offer up lighted Tapers, which the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do faſten to the knees of the Statue, and this is the reaſon why one of the knees of a great many Idols is ungilt. As for bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, they never offer up any, on the contrary they are prohibited from killing any thing.</p>
                     <p>At the Full Moon of the fifth Month,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do waſh their Idols, their <hi>Talapoins,</hi> and their Parents.</note> the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do waſh the Idol with perfumed waters, but reſpect permits them not to waſh its head.

This is the reaſon why they waſh later in the ſhorteſt days, tho' their Bell fails not to wake them before day.</p>
                     <p>Being raiſed, they go with their Superior to the Temple for two hours.<note place="margin">They go to the Temples in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> There they ſing or repeat out of the <hi>Balie,</hi> and what they ſing is written on the Leaſs of a Tree ſomewhat longiſh, and faſten'd at one of the ends, as I have ſaid in diſcourſing of the Tree which bears them. The People have not any Prayer-Book. The poſture of the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> whilſt they ſing, is to ſit croſs-leg'd, and continually to toſs their <hi>Talipat</hi> or Fan, as if they would continually fan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo that their Fan goes or comes at each Syllable which they pronounce, and they pronounce them all at equal times, and after the ſame tone.

                     <p>In going from Prayer, the <hi>Talapoins</hi> go into the City to beg Alms for an hour;<note place="margin">Then to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, on which alone they do not always live.</note>
but they never go out of the Convent, and never re-enter, without going to ſalute their Superior, before whom they proſtrated themſelves to touch the ground with their Forehead; and becauſe that the Superior ſits generally croſs-leg'd, they take one of his Feet with both their hands, and put it on their head. To crave Alms they ſtand at the Gates, without ſaying any thing; and they paſs on after a little time, if nothing is given them. It is rare that the People ſends them away without giving them, and beſides this their Parents never fail them. The Convents have likewiſe ſome Gardens, and cultivated Lands, and Slaves to plough them. All their Lands are free from Taxes, and the Prince touches them not; altho' he has the real property thereof, if he diveſts not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by writing, which he almoſt never does.</p>
                     <p>At their return from begging, the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do breakfaſt if they will,<note place="margin">How they fill up the day.</note> and are not always regular in preſenting to the Idol what they eat, tho' they do it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after the manner that I have related. Till Dinner-time they ſtudy, or employ themſelves as to them ſeems meet, and at Noon they dine. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they read a Lecture to the little <hi>Talapoins,</hi> and ſleep; and at the declining of the day they ſweep the Temple, and do there ſing as in the morning for two hours, after which they lie down.

                     <p>If any one would make himſelf a <hi>Talapoin,</hi> he begins with agreeing with ſome Superior that would receive him into his Convent; and becauſe there is none but a <hi>Sancrat,</hi> as I have ſaid, can give him the Habit, he goes to demand it of ſome <hi>Sancrat,</hi> if the Superior with whom he would remain, is not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Sancrat;</hi> and the <hi>Sancrat</hi> appoints him an hour ſome few days after, and for the Afternoon. Whoever ſhould oppoſe him would ſin; and as this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is gainful, and it laſts not neceſſarily the whole life, the Parents are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very glad to ſee their Children embrace it.

When any one therefore is to be admitted, his Parents and his Friends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to this Ceremony with Inſtruments and Dancers, and they ſtop fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the way to ſee dancing. During the Ceremony, the Demandant, and the Men that are of his Retinue, do enter into the Temple where the <hi>Sancrat</hi> is; but the Women, the Inſtruments, and the Dancers enter not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I know not who ſhaves the Head, the Eye-brows and the Beard of the Demandant, or whether he ſhaves it not himſelf. The <hi>Sancrat</hi> gives the Habit with his own hand, and he cloaths himſelf therewith, letting the ſecular Habit fall underneath when he has put on the other.

                        <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>Talapoins.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ALL the <hi>Indies</hi> are full of <hi>Talapoins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divers kinds of <hi>Talapoins</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                        </note> tho' they have not everywhere this Name, and live not everywhere after the ſame manner. Some marry, and others ſtrictly obſerve Celibacy. Some eat Meat, provided it is given them ſlain, others never eat any. Some do kill Animals, others kill none at all; and others do kill very rarely, and for ſome Sacrifice. Their Doctrine appears not more exactly the ſame in all places, tho' the Foundation thereof be always the opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis;</hi> and their Worſhip is alſo various, tho' it always refers to the dead.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems that they believe all Nature animated, not only Men,<note place="margin">How they believe the whole anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature, and what <hi>Idea</hi> they have of the Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> Beaſts and Plants, but the Heaven, the Planets, the Earth, and the other Elements, the Rivers, the Mountains, the Cities, the Houſes themſelves. And moreover, as all Souls appear to them of the ſame Nature, and indifferent to enter into all Bodies, of what kind ſoever they be, it ſeems that they have not the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Animation as we have. They believe that the Soul is in the Body, and that it rules the Body, but it appears not that they believe like us, that the Soul is phyſically united to the Body, to make one with it. So far are they from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the natural Inclinations of Souls is to be in Bodies, that they believe it is a Penance for them, to extirpate their Sins by their Sufferings, becauſe that indeed there is no kind of Life which has not its Troubles. The ſupreme Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Soul, in their opinion, is not to be obliged to animate any Body, but to remain eternally in repoſe. And the true Hell of the Soul is on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to them, the perpetual neceſſity of animating Bodies, and of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one to another by continual Tranſmigrations. 'Tis ſaid, that amongſt the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> there are ſome which boldly aſſert, that they remember their paſt Tranſmigrations; and theſe Teſtimonies do doubtleſs ſuffice to confirm the People in the Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis.</hi> The <hi>Europeans</hi> have ſometimes tranſlated by the word <hi>Tutelar Genius,</hi> the Souls which the <hi>Indians</hi> give to the Bodies, which we eſteem inanimate: But theſe <hi>Genii</hi> are certainly in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Indians</hi> only real Souls, which they ſuppoſe equally to animate all the Bodies wherein they are preſent, but after a manner which correſponds not to the <hi>Phyſical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of our Schools.</p>
                     <p>The Figure of the World, according to their Doctrine, is eternal;<note place="margin">What they think of the Eternity of the World.</note> but the World which we ſee is not, for whatever we ſee therein, lives in their Opinion, and muſt die; and at the ſame time there will ſpring up other Beings of the ſame kind, another Heaven, another Earth, and other Stars; and this is the ground of what they ſay, that they have ſeen Nature decay and revive again ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>No Opinion has been ſo generally receiv'd amongſt Men,<note place="margin">Of the nature of the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them.</note> as that of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul; but that the Soul is immaterial, is a Truth the knowledg of which is not ſo much propagated; Thus is it a very great difficulty to give
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98501:72"/>
unto a <hi>Siameſe</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of a pure Spirit; and this is the Teſtimony which the Miſſionaries give thereof, that have been longeſt amongſt them. All the <hi>Pagans</hi> of the Eaſt do believe indeed that there remains ſomething of Man after his death, which ſubſiſts ſeparately and independantly from its body; but they give extent and figure to what ramains, and in a word they attribute unto it all the ſame Members, and all the ſame ſolid and liquid Subſtances whereof our Bodies are compoſed. They ſuppoſe only that the Souls are of a matter ſubtile enough, to be free from touch and ſight; tho' they believe that if any one be wounded, the blood which flows from its wound, may appear. Such were the <hi>Manes</hi> and <hi>Shades</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and it is by this figure of the Souls like unto that of the Bodies, that <hi>Virgil</hi> ſuppoſes that <hi>Aeneas</hi> knew <hi>Palinurus, Dido,</hi> and <hi>Anchiſes</hi> in Hell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Opinion.</note>Now what is altogether impertinent in this Opinion, is, that the Orientals cannot tell why they attribute the humane Figure, rather than any other, to the Soul, which they ſuppoſe able to animate all ſorts of Bodies, beſides the humane Body. When the <hi>Tartar</hi> which now reigns at <hi>China,</hi> would force the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to ſhave their hair after the <hi>Tartarian</hi> faſhion, ſeveral of them choſe rather to ſuffer death, than to go, they ſaid, into the other World, to appear before their Anceſtors without hair; imagining, that they ſhaved the head of the Soul, by ſhaving that of the Body.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Recompences of the Soul after death.</note>The Souls therefore, tho' material, are yet imperiſhable in their Opinion; and at their departure out of this life, they are puniſhed or recompenced, with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments or Pleaſures proportioned in greatneſs and duration to their good or evil works, until they re-enter into the humane Body, wherein they muſt enjoy a Life more or leſs happy, according to the Good or Evil they have committed in a former Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the Wicked, and the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Good.</note>If a Man is unfortunate before he has done amiſs, as if he is dead-born, the <hi>Indians</hi> believe that he has merited it in a former Life, and that then perhaps he cauſed ſome Great-belly'd Woman to miſcarry. If, on the contrary, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a wicked Man to proſper, they believe that he enjoys the Recompence which he has merited in another Life by good Actions. If the Life of the Man is mixt with Proſperity and Adverſity, 'tis becauſe every Man, they ſay, has done Good and Evil when he formerly lived. In a word, no Perſon ſuffers any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, according to their Opinion, if he has always been innocent; nor is he always happy, if he has at any time been culpable; nor does he enjoy any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, which he has not merited by ſome good Action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the ſeveral places where the Soul paſſes after death.</note>Beſides the divers manners of being of this World, as of Plant, or of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, to which the Souls are ſucceſſively linked after death, they reckon ſeveral places out of this World, where the Souls are puniſhed or rewarded. Some are more happy, and others more miſerable than the World wherein we are. They make all theſe places as Stages in the whole extent of Nature, and their Books do vary in the number; tho' the moſt common Opinion is, that there are nine happy, and as many unhappy. The nine happy places are over our heads, the nine unhappy are under our feet; and the higher a place is, the happier it is; as alſo the lower it is, the more unhappy it is: ſo that the happy extend far above the Stars, as the unhappy do ſink a great way beneath the earth. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call the Inhabitants of the ſuperior Worlds <hi>Theuada,</hi> thoſe of the inferior Worlds <hi>Pii,</hi> and thoſe of this World <hi>Manout.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have tranſlated the word <hi>Theuada</hi> by that of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the word <hi>Pii</hi> by that of <hi>Devils;</hi> and they have given the Name of <hi>Paradice</hi> to the ſuperior Worlds, and that of <hi>Hell</hi> to the inferior.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">It there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives again.</note>But the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do not believe that the Souls in departing out of the Body do paſs into theſe places, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> thought that they went into Hell: they are born, according to them, at the places where they go; and there they do live a life, which from us is conceal'd, but which is ſubject to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this, and unto death. Death and a new Birth are always the road from one of theſe places to another, and it is not till after having lived in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of places, and during a certain time, which ordinarily extends to ſome thouſands of years, that the Souls there puniſhed or recompenced, do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſpring up again in the World wherein we are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98501:72"/>Now as they ſuppoſe that the Souls have a new habitation in the places where they revive, they think they ſtand in need of the things of this Life;<note place="margin">To live a life full of Cares like this.</note> and all the ancient Paganiſm believed the ſame. With the body of a dead man, the <hi>Gauls</hi> burnt the things which he had moſt eſteemed, during his Life, Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, Animals, Slaves, and even free Perſons, if he had any ſingularly devoted to his Service.</p>
                     <p>They ſtill practice worſe than this, if it is poſſible,<note place="margin">Why the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> women burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs with the body of their Husband.</note> among the Pagans of the true <hi>India,</hi> where the Wife glories in burning herſelf alive with the body of her Husband, to meet his Soul in the other world. I well know that ſome preſume that this Cuſtom was formerly introduced in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to ſecure the Husbands from the Treaſon of their Wives, by forcing them to die with them. <hi>Mandeſh</hi> reports this opinion, and <hi>Strabo</hi> had reported it before him, and had diſapproved it, thinking it improbable either that ſuch a Law was eſtabliſhed, or that ſuch a reaſon for eſtabliſhing it was true: Indeed, beſides that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is extended to the Moveables and Animals, things all innocent, it is free in regard of the Women, none of which dies after this manner, if ſhe deſires it not; and it has been received in too great a part of the Country, to imagine that the Crimes of the Women have given occaſion thereunto. Wives to be Slaves, or as Slaves to their Husbands, are not either more diſſatisfied with their Condition, nor greater Enemies to their Husbands, and they change no part of the Condition as to this regard, by a ſecond Marriage. Thus it is obſerved that the <hi>Indian</hi> Women have always look'd upon the Liberty they have of dying with their Husbands, not as a Puniſhment, but as a Felicity which is offered them. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Slaves do ſometimes follow their Miſtreſs to the Funeral Pile, but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily and without compulſion. And moreover it is not a thing without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that an Husband enamour'd with his Wife, will burn himſelf with her, in hopes of going to enjoy another Life with her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Navarette</hi> reports it is a Cuſtom of the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This Cuſtom is received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and is not without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among the <hi>Chineſes.</hi>
                        </note> that when there dies one amongſt them, one of his Wives hangs herſelf, to follow him into the other World; but that the <hi>Tartar</hi> which reigned at <hi>China</hi> in 1668. aboliſhed this Cuſtom: and he adds, that though it be not common to the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Confucius,</hi> yet it is not without example. He relates one in his time, of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Canton,</hi> who being poyſoned himſelf, and feeling the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Death, called her whom he loved the beſt of his Wives, and deſired her to follow him: which ſhe did by hanging herſelf ſo ſoon as he was dead.</p>
                     <p>But certainly neither the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> nor the <hi>Tonquineſes,</hi> nor the <hi>Siameſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> and of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors in Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</note> nor the other <hi>Indians</hi> beyond the <hi>Ganges,</hi> have ever, as it is known, received the Cuſtom of permitting the Women to burn: and moreover they have by a wiſe Oeconomy eſtabliſhed, that inſtead of real Furniture and Money, it ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to burn with the dead bodies, thoſe very things delineated in paper cut, and oftentimes painted or gilded: under pretence, in my opinion, that in matter of Types, thoſe of the things in Paper were as good as thoſe of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which the Paper repreſents. Wherefore the People report, that this Paper which is burnt, is converted in the other Life to the things which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents. The richeſt <hi>Chineſes</hi> ceaſe not to burn at leaſt ſome real Stuffs, and they burn moreover ſo much Paper, that this expence alone is conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe Oriental People do not only believe that they may be helpful to the dead, as I have already explained:<note place="margin">The power of the Dead over the Living, the Source of the worſhip of the Dead.</note> they think alſo that the dead have the power of tormenting and ſuccouring the living: and from hence comes their Care and Magnificence in Funerals; for it is only in this that they are magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. Hence it comes alſo that they pray to the dead, and eſpecially the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of their Anceſtors to the Great-Grand-Father, or to the Great-Great-Grand-Father; preſuming that the reſt are ſo diſperſed by divers Tranſmigrations, that they can hear them no more. The <hi>Romans</hi> likewiſe prayed to their dead An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, tho they believed them not to be Gods. Thus <hi>Germanicus</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> at the beginning of a military expedition beſought the <hi>Manes</hi> of his Father <hi>Druſus</hi> to render it happy, becauſe that <hi>Druſus</hi> himſelf had made war in that Country.</p>

They chuſe it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the advice of the Soothſayers, imagining that the repoſe of the deceaſed depends on this choice, and that of the felicity and repoſe of the living depends on the repoſe of the dead. If therefore they are not the Proprietors of the place declared by the Soothſayers, they fail not to buy it, and ſometimes dearly. And in the third place, beſides the Funeral Train, which is great, they give magnificent entertainments to the dead perſon, not only when they bury him, but annually on the ſame day, and ſeveral times in the year.</p>

They do again burn Perfumes, Stuffs, and cut Papers; and they do make them new repaſts. The <hi>Tonquineſes,</hi> according to Father <hi>de Rhodes,</hi> do intermix theſe ſorts of repaſts with Paper-meats, which they burn. The ſame Author very largely relates the Prayers which the <hi>Tonquineſes</hi> make to the dead, how they demand of them a long and happy Life; with what zeal they redouble their Worſhip and Prayers in their Misfortunes, when the Soothſayers aſſure them that they ought to attribute the cauſe thereof to the Anger of their Parents.</p>

                        </note> So ſoon as a man is dead his body is ſhut up in a wooden Coffin, which is varniſhed and gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the outſide: and as the Varniſh of <hi>Siam</hi> is not ſo good as that of <hi>China,</hi> and hinders not the ſtench of the dead body from paſſing through the cracks of the Coffin, they endeavour at leaſt to conſume the Inteſtines of the dead with Mercury, which they pour into his Mouth, and which, they ſay, comes out at the Fundament. They ſometimes make uſe alſo of Leaden Coffins, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they gild them: but the Wood of their Coffins is not ſo precious as at <hi>China,</hi> becauſe they are not ſo rich as the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> Out of a reſpect they place the Coffin on ſome high thing, and generally on a Bedſted which hath feet, and ſo long as the body is kept at the houſe, whether to expect the Head of the Family, if he is abſent, or to prepare the Funeral Solemnities, they burn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes and Tapers by the Coffin; and every night the <hi>Talapoins</hi> come to ſing in the <hi>Balie</hi> Language, in the Chamber where it is expoſed: they do range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves along the Walls. They entertain them, and give them ſome Money: and what they ſing are ſome moral Subjects upon Death, with the Road to Heaven, which they pretend to ſhow to the Soul of the deceaſed.</p>
                     <p>Mean while the Family chuſes a place in the Field,<note place="margin">How they burn the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> there to carry and burn the body. This place is generally a Spot near the Temple, which the Deceaſed, or ſome of his Anceſtors had built; or near ſome other Temple, if there is none peculiar to the Family of the deceaſed, This ſpace is incloſed with a ſquare incloſure made of <hi>Bambou,</hi> with ſome kind of Architecture, almoſt of the ſame work as the Arbours and Bowers of our Gardens, and adorned with thoſe Papers Painted or Gilded, which they cut to repreſent the Houſes, Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and Domeſtic and Savage Animals. In the middle of this Incloſure the Pile compoſed entirely or partly of Odoriferous wood, as are the white or yellow Saunders, and Lignum Aloes, and this according to the Wealth and Dignity of the deceaſed. But the greateſt honor of the Funeral conſiſts in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pile, not in eagerly heaping up Wood, but in great Scaffolds, on which they do put Earth, and then Wood. At the Burial of the late Queen, who died ſeven or eight years ago, the Scaffold was higher than ever was yet ſeen in this Country, and a Machine was deſired of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> to raiſe the Coffin decently to that heighth.</p>
                     <p>When it is reſolved to carry the Corps to the Pile (which is always done in the Morning) the Parents and Friends do carry it with the ſound of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtruments.

If the Train can go all the way by water, it is ſo done. In very magnificent Funerals they carry great Machines of Bambou covered with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gilded Paper, which repreſents not only Palaces, Moveables, Elephants, and other common Animals, but ſome hideous Monſters, ſome of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the humane Figure, and which the Chriſtians take for the Figures of Devils. They burn not the Coffin, but they take out the body which they leave on the Pile: and the <hi>Talapoins</hi> of the Convent, near which the body is burnt, do ſing for a quarter of an hour, and then retire to appear no more. Then begin the ſhows of the <hi>Cone</hi> and of the <hi>Rabam,</hi> which are at the ſame time, and all the day long, but on different Theaters. The <hi>Talapoins</hi> think not that they can be preſent thereat without Sin; and theſe Shows are not exhibited at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals upon any religious Account, but only to render them more magnificent. To the Ceremony they add a feſtival Air, and yet the Relations of the deceaſed forbear not to make great Lamentations, and to ſhed many Tears, but they hire no Mourners, as ſome have aſſured me.</p>

If it is the Body of a Prince of the Blood, or of a Lord whom the King has loved, the King himſelf ſets fire to the Pile,

without ſtirring out of his Palace. He lets go a lighted Torch along a Rope, which is extended from one of the Windows of the Palace to the Pile. As to the cut Papers, which are naturally deſigned for the Flames, the <hi>Talapoins</hi> do frequently ſecure them, and ſeize them to lend them to other Funerals; and the Family of the deceaſed permits them to do it. In which it appears that they have forgot the reaſon, why the neighbouring Nations diſpence not from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Papers effectually: and in general it may be aſſerted, that there are no Perſons in the world, which do ignore their own Religion ſo much as the <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poins.</hi> It is very difficult, ſay ſome, to find any one amongſt them that knows any thing.

This participates of the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who communicate as much as they can to their dead Relations, the Honors to which they arrive.

nor Women that die in Child-bed, nor thoſe which drown themſelves, or which periſh by any other extraordinary diſaſter, as by a Thunderbolt. They rank theſe unfortunate perſons amongſt the guilty, becauſe they believe that ſuch Misfortunes never happen to innocent Perſons.</p>

On the contrary, the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have no forced Mourning: they give marks of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row only as much as they are Afflicted; ſo that it is more common at <hi>Siam,</hi> that the Father and the Mother put on Mourning for their Children, than that the Children wear it for their Father and Mother. Sometimes the Father turns <hi>Talapoin</hi> and the Mother <hi>Talapoineſſe,</hi> or at leaſt they ſhave the head one of the other: but there is only the true <hi>Talapoins,</hi> that can likewiſe ſhave the Eye-brows.</p>
                     <p>To me it appeared not that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> invoke their dead Parents,<note place="margin">Whether the <hi>Siameſes</hi> pray to the Dead.</note> what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ſoever I have made upon it; but they ceaſe not to believe themſelves frequently tormented with their Apparitions: and then they carry Viands to their Tombs, which the Beaſts do eat; and they give Alms for them to the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapoins,</hi> becauſe they think that Charity is a Ranſom for the Sins of the dead, as well as of the living. Beſides this the <hi>Siameſes</hi> almoſt on all occaſions, do offer up Prayers to the good <hi>Genij,</hi> and imprecations againſt the bad, of which I have already given ſome examples; And theſe <hi>Genij</hi> are certainly in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only Souls, all as I have ſaid, of the ſame Nature.</p>

The good <hi>Genij</hi> are all the other Souls, eſteemed more or leſs good, according as they have been more or leſs Virtuous in this life. And this wholly reſembles the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> who requires that one ſhould adhere to Vertue during life, to the end that the cuſtom thereof may continue after death. This amounts likewiſe to that Antient O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which was ſpread alſo amongſt ſome of the Antient Chriſtians, that the Souls of the good are changed into Angels, and the Souls of the wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Devils. But amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> this doctrine is no other, than that the Souls of the good, ſpring up again after Death, in one of thoſe places, which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have called <hi>Paradice,</hi> and the Souls of the wicked, in one of thoſe other places, which they do call <hi>Hell.</hi> Some continuing to be good after Death, do good to men, others continuing to be wicked, do hurt to men, and every thing elſe, as much as they can. And who knows whether theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Paradices</hi> which they believe, are not a confuſed remembrance of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Orders of the Celeſtial Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Now through an incredible blindneſs,<note place="margin">The <hi>Indians</hi> have no God which is the Judge of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions.</note> the <hi>Indians</hi> admit not any Intelligent Being, which judges of the goodneſs or badneſs of Humane actions, and which orders the Puniſhment or Recompence thereof.

and light things to aſcend. And becauſe that nothing more repugns reaſon, than to ſuppoſe an exact Juſtice in chance, or in the Neceſſity of Fate, the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> People incline themſelves to believe ſomething Corporeal in good or bad works, which, they ſay, has the power of doing unto men, the Good or Evil which they deſerve.

                        <note place="margin">The firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept extends to Plants and Seeds.</note>The firſt Precept is not limited to the Killing either Men or Animals: but it extends to Plants, and to Seeds; becauſe that by a very probable Opinion, they believe that the Seed is only the Plant it ſelf in a Cover. The Man therefore obſerving this Precept, as they underſtand it, can live only on Fruit; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they conſider the Fruit not as a thing which has Life, but as a part of a thing which has Life, and which ſuffers not, though its Fruit be pluck'd. In eating the Fruit it is neceſſary only not to eat the Kernel nor Stone, becauſe they are Seeds: and it is neceſſary not to eat Fruit out of ſeaſon, that is to ſay, in my opinion, before the Seaſon; becauſe that it is to make the Seed, which the Fruit contains, abortive, by hindering it from ripening.</p>

                        <note place="margin">And to the not deſtroying any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>Beſides this, the Precept of not killing, extends to the not deſtroying any thing in Nature: by reaſon they think that every thing is animated, or if you will, that there are Souls every where, and that to deſtroy any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is forceably to diſpoſſeſs a Soul. They will not, for inſtance, break a Branch of a Tree, as they will not break the Arm of an innocent Perſon. They believe that it is to offend the Soul of the Tree. But when once the Soul has been expelled out of a body, they look upon this as a Deſtruction already wrought, and think nothing to be deſtroyed in nouriſhing themſelves with this Body. The <hi>Talapoins</hi> make not any ſcruple of eating what is dead, but of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what they think alive.</p>

                        <note place="margin">In ſeveral things they do more abhor Blood than Murder.</note>In ſeveral things they teſtify a greater Abhorrence of Blood, than of Murder: It is prohibited them to make any Inciſion, from whence there guſhes out Blood; as if the Soul was principally in the Blood, or that it was only the Blood. And this perhaps is a confuſed remembrance of the ancient Command of God, who permitting unto man the uſe of Meats, prohibited him from eating the Blood of the Animals, <hi>becauſe that the Blood ſupplys in them the place of the Soul.</hi> There are ſome <hi>Indians</hi> which dare not to cut a certain Plant, becauſe there comes out a red Juice, which they take for the Blood of this Plant. The <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> do ſcruple to go a fiſhing, only on the days when the <hi>Talapoins</hi> ſhave their Head. This done, it ſeems to them that when they fiſh, they commit no Crime; by reaſon they think not themſelves guilty of the Death of the Fiſhes. They ſay they only pull them out of the Water, and ſhed not their Blood. The leaſt evaſion ſufficeth them to elude the Precepts. Thus they think not to ſin by killing in War, becauſe they ſhoot not direct at the Enemy: though at the bottom they endeavour to kill, as I have already explained it, diſcourſing of their manner of fighting.</p>

Murder oftentimes appears laudable, ſeeing that it may deliver a Soul from a miſerable Life: They anſwer that forceably to diſpoſſeſs Souls is always to offend them; and that moreover they are not relieved, becauſe they re enter into the like Bodies, there to fill up the reſt of the time, during which they are deſigned for this ſort of Life. But they conſider not that this reaſon would alſo prove that they did no real Injury in killing: and the <hi>Chineſes</hi> who in this do think otherwiſe than the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> do kill their Children when they have too many, and they alledge that it is to make them ſpring up more happy.<note place="margin">To kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appears to them a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laudable thing.</note>

                     <p>Moreover all the <hi>Indians</hi> do think, that to kill themſelves is not only a thing permitted, becauſe they believe themſelves Maſters of their ſelves; but that it is a Sacrifice advantageous to the Soul, and which acquires it a great degree of Vertue and Felicity.

Without this pretended neceſſity they would believe Marriage unlawful, and ſo ſoon as they have Children, they think it a Vertue to make a Divorce. They cite the example of <hi>Confucius,</hi> who quitted his Wife when he had a Son: they alledge the example of this Son, who likewiſe quitted his; and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and opinion of ſeveral other <hi>Chineſe</hi> Philoſophers, who have made a Divorce with their Wives, and who have eſteemed the Divorce amongſt the virtuous Actions.

                     <p>'Tis thus that they underſtand their Precepts, neither do they believe that real Vertue is made for every one, but only for the <hi>Talapoins.</hi> They think that what is Sin in itſelf, is Sin for all; and the <hi>Talapoins</hi> make neither Vow, nor any thing whatever, which is a Sin in them, which is not a Sin to all the World; but according to them, the Trade of Seculars is to ſin, and that of the <hi>Talapoins</hi> not to ſin, and to exerciſe Repentance for thoſe that ſin. They comprehend like us, that thoſe who are deſigned to expiate the Sins of others by Repentance, ought to be more pure than others; and that the Puniſhment due and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily annext to Sin, may yet paſs from the guilty to the innocent, if the innocent will willingly ſubmit himſelf to deliver the guilty. Moreover they conceive the Nature of Sin very groſly, and very materially; for the <hi>Talapoins</hi> content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with abſtaining from Actions which they think wicked, but they ſcruple not to make the Seculars commit them, to get Advantage thereby. Thus when they would eat Rice, Rice being a Seed they cannot boil it without Sin, becauſe it is to kill it: But they make their <hi>Tapacaou,</hi> which are their Domeſtic Seculars, or rather they cauſe the <hi>Talapoin-Children,</hi> which they educate, to commit this pretended Sin; and when the Rice is boiled, then they eat it. They are alſo prohibited to piſs on the Fire, or in the Water, or on the Earth, becauſe that this would be to extinguiſh the Fire, or to corrupt thoſe two other Elements: they piſs in ſome Veſſel, and a Secular Servant pours it where he pleaſes, and it matters not whether he ſins. The Seculars do therefore obſerve, or elude the Precepts only through the fear of the publick Chaſtiſements, or through the natural ſtrangeneſs which they might have to what they ſhall think Sin; but they ranſom their Sins by their good Works, which principally conſiſt in beſtowing Alms on the Temples and <hi>Talapoins,</hi> according to the ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion known perhaps throughout the Earth, and ſo frequently repeated in the Holy Scripture, that Alms deeds ranſom Sins. It is eaſie alſo to obſerve in them a very natural and very juſt ſentiment, which is that they much more condemn the Sins which may be eaſily avoided, than thoſe which are inevitable, though they think that all are Sins. But to the end that the Morality of the <hi>Talapoins</hi> may be better underſtood, I will inſert at the end of this Work, moſt of their Maxims verbatim, as they were given me. I will add only ſome Remarks to make them better underſtood.</p>

                        </note>There will be ſeen the reſpect which they have for the Elements, and for all Nature. They are prohibited to ſpeak injuriouſly of any thing natural; to dig any hole in the Earth, and not to fill it up again after they have done it; to boil the Earth, as to boil Rice; to kindle the Fire, becauſe it is to deſtroy that with which it is kindled; and to extinguiſh it when it is once kindled. There we ſhall ſee that they take care of Purity and Decency, as much as of real Virtue: that they have ſome Idea's of almoſt all the Virtues, and that they have hardly any that is exact; becauſe they carry ſome to ſuperſtitious ſcruples, and that they live ſhort of others.</p>

They are ſurprized at the Beauty of our Morality, when it is told them that it equally invites all men to Vertue, becauſe they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not that this can be a thing practicable: but when they are made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and are informed that Vertue conſiſts not in thoſe impoſſible things, wherein they place it, they contemn what is told them, and do believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more pure and virtuous than the Chriſtians: or rather they return again to believe that they alone are <hi>Creeng,</hi> that is to ſay pure, and that the Chriſtians are <hi>Cahat,</hi> or deſigned to ſin, like the reſt of Mankind: A prevention which muſt quite confound us, and which proves the extream neceſſity which humane reaſon has of a ſuperior Light, not to err in the knowledge of good and evil, the Idea's of which do nevertheleſs appear unto us ſo eaſie, and ſo natural.</p>

But moreover I believe that a wiſe Policy has greatly contributed to interdict State-Affairs to perſons, who have ſo great a Power upon the Minds of the People. They underſtand Religious Obedience. Obedience is the Vertue of every one in this Country, and it is no wonder that it is found in their Cloiſters. They likewiſe underſtand Chaſtity. A <hi>Talapoin</hi> ſins, if he coughs to attract on him the Eyes of the Women, if he beholds a Woman with Complacency, or if he deſires one; if he uſes Perfumes about his Perſon, if he puts Flowers to his Ears: and in a word, if he adorns himſelf with too much Care.

                     <p>IT remains for me to explain wherein they place perfect Felicity,<note place="margin">Perfect Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> that is to ſay, the ſupream Recompence of good Works, and the utmoſt Degree of Unhappineſs, that is to ſay the greateſt Puniſhment of the Guilty. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve therefore that if by ſeveral Tranſmigrations, and by a great number of good Works in all the Lives, a Soul acquires ſo much Merit, that there is not in any World any mortal Condition, that is worthy of it; they believe, I ſay, that this Soul is then exempt from every Tranſmigration, and every Animation, that it has nothing more to do; that it neither revives, nor dies any more; but that it enjoys an eternal Unactivity, and a real Impaſſibility. <hi>Nireupan,</hi> ſay they, that is to ſay this Soul has diſappeared: it will return no more in any World:<note place="margin">What the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> have called <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> are neither the Perfect Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to the <hi>Siameſes.</hi>
                        </note> and 'tis this word which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have tranſlated <hi>it is annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> and likewiſe thus, <hi>It is become a God,</hi> though in the Opinion of the <hi>Siame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> this is not a real Annihilation, nor an Acquiſition of any divine Nature.</p>
                     <p>Such is therefore the true Paradice of the <hi>Indians:</hi> for tho' they ſuppoſe a great Felicity in the higheſt of the nine Paradices, of which we have already diſcourſed; yet they ſay that this Felicity is not eternal, nor exempt from all Inquietude; ſeeing that it is a kind of life, where one is born, and where one

dies. By the like reaſon, their true Hell is not any of thoſe nine places which we have called Hell, and in ſome of which they ſuppoſe Torments and eternal Flames: for tho' there may eternally be ſome Souls in theſe Hells, theſe will not always be the ſame: No Soul will be eternally puniſhed; they will revive again to live there a certain time, and to depart thence by death.</p>

They believe, that it is for the Sins of theſe Souls, and for their want of ever acquiring a ſufficient merit, that they ſhall continually paſs from one Body to another. The Body, whatever it be, is always according to them, a Priſon for the Soul, wherein it is puniſhed for its Faults.</p>

                        </note>And this is certainly the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> in which I find no <hi>Idea</hi> of a Divinity. The Gods of the ancient <hi>Paganiſm</hi> which we know, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Nature, puniſhed the wicked, and recompenc'd the good; and tho' they were born like Men, they came of an immortal Race, and knew not death. The Gods of <hi>Epicurus</hi> took care of nothing, no more than <hi>Sommona-Codom;</hi> but it appears not that they were Men arrived thro' their Vertue at that ſtate of an happy Inactivity, they were not born, neither did they dye. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a firſt Mover, that is to ſay a powerful Being, who had ranged Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who had given it, as I may ſay, the ſwing, which preſerv'd the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny therein. But the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have not any ſuch <hi>Idea,</hi> being far from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a God Creator; and ſo I believe it may be aſſerted, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have no <hi>Idea</hi> of any God, and that their Religion is reduced all intire to the worſhip of the dead. And it is neceſſary that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> underſtand it thus, and that they think not that <hi>Pagode</hi> ſignifies <hi>God:</hi> for Father <hi>Magaillans</hi> informs us, that they are offended when <hi>Confucius</hi> is treated as a <hi>Pagode;</hi> becauſe this is to treat him not as God, which would not be an injury to <hi>Confucius:</hi> but as a Man arrived at the ſupreme Vertue of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do think very much inferior to the Vertue of <hi>Confucius.</hi>

His Providence and his Power have been no more than a limited Providence and Power, tho' nevertheleſs a great deal more extenſive than the ſtrength and prudence of Men. <hi>It ſeems,</hi> ſays Father <hi>Trigaut, in the first Book of his Chriſtian Expedition to</hi> China, chap. 10. <hi>That the ancient</hi> Chineſes <hi>have believed the Heaven and the Earth animated, and that they have ador'd the Soul as a Supreme God, calling him the King of Heaven, or ſimply the Heaven and the Earth.</hi> Father <hi>Trigaut</hi> might raiſe the ſame doubt upon all things; for the Doctrine of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> has continually attributed Spirits to the four parts of the World, to the Planets, to the Mountains, to the Rivers, to the Plants, to the Cities and their Ditches, to Houſes and their Chimnies, and, in a word, to all things. And all the Spirits appear not good to them; they acknowledge ſome wicked ones, to be the immediate cauſe of the miſchiefs and diſaſters to which the humane life is ſubject. Moreover, as they thought the Earth and the Sea fixt to the Heaven by the Horizon, they have attributed but one Spirit or one Soul to the Heaven and the Earth; tho' nevertheleſs, and perhaps by ſome thought contrary to their firſt opinion, they have built two different Temples, the one conſecrated to the Heaven, and the other to the Earth.</p>
                     <p>As therefore the Soul of Man was, in their opinion,<note place="margin">They have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from God the infinite Providence and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> the ſource of all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Actions of Man; ſo they gave a Soul unto the Sun, to be the ſource of its qualities and of its motions: and on this Principle the Soul's diffuſed every where, cauſing in all Bodies the Actions which appear natural to theſe Bodies, there needs no more to explain in this opinion the whole oeconomie of Nature, and to ſupply the Omnipotence, and infinite Providence, which they admit not in any Spirit, not even in that of the Heaven.</p>
                     <p>In truth, as it ſeems that Man, uſing things natural for his nouriſhment,<note place="margin">They have made God as a King of all Nature, but not a King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obeyed.</note> or for his conveniency, has ſome power over things Natural, the ancient opinion of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> allowing ſuch a like power proportionably to all the Souls, ſuppoſed that that of the Heaven might act over Nature, with a prudence and ſtrength incomparably greater than Humane Prudence and Power. But at the ſame time it acknowledg'd in the Soul of every thing, an interior force, independent by its nature from the Power of Heaven, and which acted ſometimes againſt the Deſigns of Heaven. The Heaven governed Nature as a powerful King: the other Souls paid Obedience to him: He almoſt continually forced them, but ſome there were which ſometimes diſpenced with obeying him.<note place="margin">

                           <p>The Antient <hi>Chineſes</hi> have divided the Juſtice of God.</p>
                           <p>The Juſtice of Heaven was principally buſied in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Faults of the Kings of <hi>China.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </note>Thus the <hi>Indians</hi> have conſecrated no Temples to the Spirits, not ſo much as to that of Heaven: becauſe they believe them all Souls, like all the reſt, which are ſtill in the courſe of Tranſmigration, that is to ſay in Sin, and in the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of different ſorts of life, and conſequently unworthy of having Altars.</p>
                     <p>But if the ancient <hi>Chineſes</hi> have, as I may ſay, reduc'd the Providence and Omnipotence of God into piece-meals, they have not leſs divided his Juſtice. They aſſert that the Spirits, like concealed Miniſters, were principally buſied in puniſhing the hidden faults of men; that the Spirit of Heaven puniſhed the faults of the King, the Miniſtring Spirits of Heaven the faults of the King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and ſo of other Spirits in regard of other men.</p>
                     <p>On this Foundation they ſaid to their King, that though he was the adoptive Son of Heaven, yet the Heaven would not have any regard to him by any ſort of Affliction, but by the ſole conſideration of the good or evil, that he ſhould do in the Government of his Kingdom. They called the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Empire, the <hi>Celeſtial Command;</hi> becauſe, ſaid they, a King of <hi>China</hi> ought to govern his State, as Heaven governed Nature, and that it was to Heaven, that he ought to ſeek the Science of Governing. They acknowledged that not only the Art of Ruling was a Preſent from Heaven; but that Regality it ſelf was given by Heaven, and that it was a preſent difficult to keep; becauſe that they ſuppoſed that Kings could not maintain themſelves on the Throne without the ſavour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor pleaſe Heaven but by Vertue.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Kings reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the manners of their Subjects.</note>They carried this Doctrine ſo far, that they pretended that the ſole Vertue of Kings, might render their Subjects Vertuous; and that thereby the Kings were firſt reſponſible to Heaven for the wicked manners of their Kingdom. The Vertue of Kings, that is to ſay, the Art of Ruling according to the Laws of <hi>China,</hi> was, in their Opinion a Donative from Heaven, which they called <hi>Celeſtial Reaſon,</hi> or Reaſon given by Heaven, and like to that of Heaven: The Vertue of Subjects, according to them, <hi>the regards of the Citizens, as well from one to another, as from all towards their Prince, according to the Laws of China,</hi> was the work of good Kings. 'Tis a ſmall matter, ſaid they, to puniſh Crimes, it is neceſſary, that a King prevents them by his Vertue. They extoll one of their Kings for having reigned Twenty two years, the People not perceiving,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98501:78"/>
that is to ſay, not feeling the weight of the Royal Authority, no more than the force which moves Nature, and which they attribute to Heaven. They report then that for theſe Twenty two years there was not one ſingle Proceſs in all <hi>China,</hi> nor one ſingle Execution of Juſtice; a Wonder which they call <hi>to govern imperceptably like the Heaven,</hi> and which alone may cauſe a doubt of the Fidelity of their Hiſtory. Another of their Kings meeting, as they ſay, a Criminal, which was lead to Puniſhment, took it upon himſelf, for that under his Reign he committed Crimes worthy of Death. And another ſeeing <hi>China</hi> afflicted with Sterility for ſeven years, condemned himſelf, if their Hiſtory may be credited, to bear the Crimes of his People, as thinking himſelf only culpable; and reſolved to devote himſelf to death, and to ſacrifice himſelf to the Spirit of Heaven, the Revenger of the Crimes of Kings. But their Hiſtory adds, that Heaven, ſatisfied with the Piety of that Prince, exempted him from that Sacrifice, and reſtored Fertility to the Lands by a ſudden and plentiful Rain. As the Heaven therefore executes Juſtice only upon the King, and that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts it only upon the King for what it ſees puniſhable in the People, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Heaven do execute Juſtice on the ſecret Faults which the King's Miniſters commit, and all the Officers which depend upon them: and after the ſame manner the other Spirits do watch over the Actions of the Men, that in the Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> have a rank equal to that, which theſe Spirits do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the invincible Monarchy of Nature, whereof the Spirit of Heaven is King.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this the natural Honor which moſt men have of the dead,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chineſes</hi> fear their dead Parents.</note> whom they knew very well in their Life-time; and the Opinion which ſeveral have of having ſeen them appear to them, whether by an effect of this natural Honor, which repreſents them to them, or by Dreams ſo lively, that they reſemble the Truth; do induce the ancient <hi>Chineſes</hi> to believe that the Souls of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, which they judged to be of very ſubtile matter, pleaſed themſelves in continuing about their Poſterity; and that they might, though after their death, chaſtiſe the Faults of their Children. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> People ſtill continue in theſe opinions of the temporal Puniſhments, and Rewards which come from the Soul of Heaven, and from all the other Souls; though moreover for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part they have embraced the Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> unknown to their Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>But by little and little the Men of Letters, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">The Impiety of the preſent <hi>Chineſes</hi> which are men of Learning.</note> thoſe that have ſome degrees of Literature, and who alone have a Hand in the Government, being become altogether impious, and yet having altered nothing in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their Predeceſſors; have made of the Soul of Heaven, and of all the other Souls, I know not what aerial ſubſtances, uuprovided of Intelligence; and for the Judge of our Works, they have eſtabliſhed a blind Fatality; which, in their opinion, makes that which might exerciſe an Omnipotent and Illuminated Juſtice. How ancient this Impiety is at <hi>China,</hi> belongs not to me to determin. Father <hi>de Rhodes</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> accuſes <hi>Confucius</hi> himſelf therewith: Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> to whom we owe the Tranſlation of ſeveral of this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Works, pretends to juſtifie him; and he at the ſame time recites ſeveral Arguments of the modern <hi>Chineſes,</hi> by which they endeavour to demonſtrate, that it is a thing wholly conformable to the Principles of Nature, that by the ſecret, but certain ſympathies, between Vertue and Felicity, and between Vice and Infelicity, Vertue muſt always be proſperous, and Vice always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: but in truth their Arguments are ſo elevated, and ſo forced, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond ſo ill to the Language of their Anceſtors, that it is very apparent that they are only the effect of a great extravagancy of Imagination, which was not in their Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do not leſs dread Spirits, than the <hi>Chineſes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have no other Judge of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions than Fatality</note> though they imagine not perhaps the Conformity between the Kingdom of the dead and theirs; and moreover they have not loſt the Idea of the Divinity leſs than the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and that they have yet preſerved this ancient Maxim, which promiſes Rewards to Vertue, and which threatens Sin with Puniſhments; they have found out no other way, than to attribute this diſtributive Juſtice to a blind Fatality. So
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98501:79"/>
that according to them, 'tis the Fatality which makes the Soul to paſs from one ſtate to a better or a worſe, and which retains them more or leſs proportionably to their good or bad works.

They believe Spirits every where diffuſed, good and bad, capable of aiding and of hurting, but which are no other than the Souls of the dead; and they admit the Worſhip of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, though they raiſe no Altars to them; but only to the <hi>Manes</hi> of the men, whom they conceive to be arrived at the higheſt degree of Vertue, as far as they think Vertue poſſible.

His Mother, whoſe Name is found in ſome of their <hi>Balie</hi> Books, was called, as they ſay, <hi>Maha Maria,</hi> which ſeems to ſignifie the <hi>great Mary,</hi> for <hi>Maha</hi> ſignifies <hi>great.</hi> But it is found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Mania,</hi> as often as <hi>Maria:</hi> which proves almoſt that theſe are two words <hi>Man-ya,</hi> becauſe that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do confound the <hi>n</hi> with the <hi>r</hi> only at the end of the words, or at the end of the Syllables, which are followed with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant. However it be, this ceaſes not to give attention to the Miſſionaries, and has perhaps given occaſion to the <hi>Siameſes</hi> to believe, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> being the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> was Brother to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and that having been crucified, he was that wicked Brother whom they give to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Thevetat,</hi> and whom they report to be puniſhed in Hell, with a Puniſhment which participates ſomething of the Croſs. The Father of <hi>Sommona Codom</hi> was, according to this ſame <hi>Balie</hi> Book, a King of <hi>Teve Lanca,</hi> that is to ſay, a King of the famous <hi>Ceylon.</hi> But the <hi>Balie</hi> Books being without Date, and without the Author's Name, have no more Authority than all the Traditions, whoſe Origin is unkown. This now is what they relate of <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis ſaid, that he beſtowed all his Eſtate in Alms, and that his Charity not being yet ſatisfied, he pluck'd out his Eyes, and ſlew his Wife and Children, to give them to the <hi>Talapoins</hi> of his Age to eat. A ſtrange contrariety of Idea's in this People, who prohibit nothing ſo much as to kill, and who relate the moſt execrable Parricides, as the moſt meritorious works of <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they think that under the Title of Property a Man has as much Power over the Lives of his Wife and Children, as to them it ſeems he has over his own: For it matters not if otherwiſe the Royal Authority prohibits particular <hi>Siameſes</hi> from making uſe of this pretended Right of Life and Death over their Wives, Children and Slaves; whereas it alone exerts it equally over all its Subjects, it may upon this Maxim of the deſpotic Government, that the Life of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects properly belong to the King.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> expect another <hi>Sommona Codom,</hi> I mean another miraculous man like him, whom they already name <hi>Pra Narotte,</hi> and whom they ſuppoſe to have been foretold by <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> And they before-hand report of him, that he ſhall kill two Children which he ſhall have, that he will give them to the <hi>Talapoins</hi> to eat, and that it will be by this pious Charity that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate his Vertue. This expectation of a new God, to make uſe of this Term, renders them careful and credulous, as often as any one is propoſed to them, as an extraordinary Perſon; eſpecially if he that is propoſed to them, is entirely ſtupid, becauſe that the entire Stupidity reſembles what they repreſent by the Inactivity and Impaſſibility of the <hi>Nireupan.</hi> As for example, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſome years ſince at <hi>Siam,</hi> a young Boy born dumb, and ſo ſtupid, that he ſeemed to have nothing humane but the Shape: yet the Report ſpread it ſelf
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98501:80"/>
through the whole Kingdom, that he was of the firſt men, which inhabited this Country, and that he would one day become a God, that is to ſay arrive at the <hi>Nireupan.</hi> The People flocked to him from all parts, to adore him and make him Preſents, till that the King fearing the conſequences of this Folly, cauſed it to ceaſe by the Chaſtiſement of ſome of thoſe, that ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced. I have read ſome ſuch thing in <hi>Toſi</hi>'s <hi>India Orientale,</hi> Tom. I. pag. 203. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that the <hi>Bonzees</hi> of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> having taken away from them a ſtupid Infant, ſhow'd him to the People as a God, and that after having inrich'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Preſents which the People made him, they publiſhed that this pretended God would burn himſelf; and he adds that they indeed burnt him publickly, after having ſtupified his Senſes by ſome Drink, and calling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible ſtate, wherein they had put him, Extaſie. This laſt Hiſtory is given as a crafty Trick of the <hi>Bonzees,</hi> but it demonſtrates, as well as the firſt, the Belief which theſe People have, that there may daily ſpring up ſome new God, and the Inclination which they have to take extream Stupidity, for a beginning of the <hi>Nireupan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> being diſingaged, by the Alms-deeds which I have mentioned, from all the Bands of Life, devoted himſelf to Faſting, to Prayer, and to the other Exerciſes of the perfect Life: But as theſe Practiſes are poſſible only to the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> he embraced the Profeſſion of a <hi>Talapoin;</hi> and when he had heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his good works, he immediately acquired all the Priviledges thereof.</p>
                     <p>He found himſelf endowed with ſo great a Strength, that in a Duel he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed another man of a conſummated Vertue, whom they call <hi>Pra Souane,</hi> and who doubting of the Perfection whereunto <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> was arrived, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged him to try his Strength, and was vanquiſht. This <hi>Pra Souane</hi> is not the ſole God, or rather the ſole perfect Man, which they pretend to have been contemporary with <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> They name ſeveral others, as <hi>Pra Ariaſeria,</hi> of whom they report that he was Forty Fadoms high, that his Eyes were three and a half broad, and two and a half round, that is to ſay, leſs in Circumference than Diameter, if there is no fault in the Writing from whence I have taken this Remark. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have a time of Wonders, as had the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have. For Inſtance, their principal Book, which they believe to be the work of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> relates, that a certain Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant had Three and thirty Heads, that each of its Heads had ſeven Teeth, every Tooth ſeven Pools, every Pool ſeven Flowers, every Flower ſeven Leafs, every Leaf ſeven Towers, and every Tower ſeven other things, which had each ſeven others, and theſe likewiſe others, and always by ſeven; for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have always been a great Subject of Superſtition. Thus in the Alcoran, if my Memory deceives me not, there is an Angel with a very great number of Heads, each of which hath as many Mouths, and every Mouth as many Tongues, which do praiſe God as many times every day.</p>
                     <p>Beſides corporal ſtrength, <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> had the power of doing all ſorts of Miracles. For example, he could make himſelf as big and as great as he pleas'd: and on the contrary, he could render himſelf ſo little, that he could ſteal out of ſight, and ſtand on the head of another man, without being felt either by his weight, or perceived by the Eyes of another. Then he could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate himſelf, and place ſome other man in his ſtead: that is to ſay, that then he could enjoy the repoſe of the <hi>Nireupan.</hi> He ſuddenly and perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the things of the World: He equally penetrated things paſt and to come, and having given to his body an entire Agility, he eaſily tranſported himſelf from one place to another, to preach Vertue to all Nations.</p>
                     <p>He had two principal Diſciples, the one on the right Hand, and the other on the left: they were both plac'd behind him, and by each other's ſide on the Altars, but their Statues are leſs than his. He that is plac'd on his right Hand is called <hi>Pra Mogla,</hi> and he that is on his left Hand is called <hi>Pra Scaribout.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind theſe three Statues, and on the ſame Altar, they only repreſent the Officers within the Palace of <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> I know not whether they have Names. Along the Galleries or Cloyſters, which are ſometimes round the Temples, are the Statues of the other Officers without the Palace of <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> Of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98501:81"/>
                        <hi>Pra Mogla</hi> they report, that at the requeſt of the damned he overturned the Earth, and took the whole Fire of Hell into the hollow of his Hand: but that deſigning to extinguiſh it, he could not effect it, becauſe that this Fire dried up the Rivers, inſtead of extinguiſhing, and that it conſumed all that whereon <hi>Pra Mogla</hi> placed it: <hi>Pra Mogla</hi> therefore went to beſeech <hi>Pra Pouti Tchaou,</hi> or <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom,</hi> to extinguiſh Hell Fire: but though <hi>Pra Pouti Tchaou</hi> could do it, he thought it not convenient, becauſe, he ſaid, that men would grow too wicked, if he ſhould deſtroy the Fear of this Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>But after that <hi>Pra Pouti Tchaou</hi> was arrived at this high Vertue, he ceaſed not to kill a <hi>Mar,</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> (for they write <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> though they pronounce always Man) and as a Puniſhment for this great fault, his Life exceeded not Eighty years, after which he died, by diſappearing on a ſudden, like a Spark which is loſt in the Air.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Man</hi> were a People Enemies to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> whom they called <hi>Paya Man;</hi> and becauſe they ſuppoſe that this People was an Enemy to ſo holy a Man, they do repreſent them as a monſtrous People, with a very large Viſage, with Teeth horrible for their Size, and with Serpents on their Head inſtead of Hair.</p>
                     <p>One day then as <hi>Pra Pouti Tchaou</hi> eat Pig's fleſh, he had a Chollick fit which killed him: An admirable end for a man ſo abſtemious: but it was neceſſary that he died by a Pig, becauſe they ſuppoſe that the Soul of the <hi>Man</hi> whom he ſlew, was not then in the Body of a <hi>Man,</hi> but in the Body of a Pig: as if a Soul could be eſteemed, even according to their Opinion, the Soul of a <hi>Man,</hi> when it is in the Body of a Pig. But all theſe inventers of Stories are not ſo attentive to the Principles of their Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> before his Death, ordered that ſome Statues and Temples ſhould be Conſecrated to him, and ſince his Death he is in that State of repoſe, which they expreſs by they word <hi>Nireupan.</hi> This is not a place but a kind of Being: for to ſpeak truly, they ſay <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> is no where, and he enjoys not any Felicity: he is without power, and out of a condition to do either Good or Evil unto Men: expreſſions which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have rendered by the word Annihilation. Nevertheleſs on the other hand the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do eſteem <hi>Sommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-Codom</hi> happy, they offer up Prayers unto him, and demand of him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they want: whether that their Doctrine agrees not with it ſelf; or that they extend their worſhip beyond their Doctrine: but in what Senſe ſoever they attribute Power to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> they agree that he has it only over the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> and that he concerns not himſelf with other People, who adore other Men beſides him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">That it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> never has been.</note>As therefore they report nothing but Fables of their <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> that they reſpect him not as the Author of their Laws and their Doctrine, but at moſt as him who has re-eſtabliſhed them amongſt Men, and that in fine they have no reaſonable Memory of him, it may be doubted, in my Opinion, that there ever was ſuch a man. He ſeems to have been invented to be the Idea of a Man, whom Vertue, as they apprehend it, has rendered happy, in the times of their Fables, that is to ſay beyond what their Hiſtories contain certain. And becauſe that they have thought neceſſary to give at the ſame time an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Idea of a Man, whom his wickedneſs has ſubjected to great Torments, they have certainly invented that <hi>Thevetat,</hi> whom they ſuppoſe to have been Brother to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and his Enemy. They make them both to be <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poins,</hi> and when they alledge that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> has been King, they report it, as they declare he has been an Ape and a Pig. They ſuppoſe that in the ſeveral Tranſmigrations of his Soul he has been all things, and allways excellent in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, that is to ſay he has been the moſt commendable of all Pigs, as the moſt commendable of all Kings. I know not from whence Mr. <hi>Gervaiſe</hi> judges that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> pretend that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> was of their Country: I have ſeen nothing thereof in the Relations of <hi>China,</hi> but only what I have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Chekia</hi> or <hi>Chaka.</hi>

                     <p>I muſt not omit what I borrow from Mr. <hi>Harbelot.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A conjecture upon the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and what Language the <hi>Baly</hi> may be.</note> I have thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſult him about what I know of the <hi>Siameſe;</hi> to the end that he might obſerve what the words which I know thereof, have in common with the <hi>Arabian, Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian:</hi> and he informed that <hi>Suman,</hi> which muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Souman,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Perſian,</hi> and that <hi>Codum,</hi> or <hi>Codom,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Ancient</hi> in the ſame Tongue; ſo that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſeems to ſignifie the <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>uncreated Heaven,</hi> becauſe that in <hi>Perſian</hi> and in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Ancient implys likewiſe <hi>uncreated</hi> or <hi>eternal.</hi> And as touching the <hi>Baly</hi> Tongue, he informed me, that the ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> is called <hi>Pahalevi,</hi> or <hi>Pahali,</hi> and that between <hi>Pahali</hi> and <hi>Bahali</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> make no Difference. Add that the word <hi>Pout,</hi> which in <hi>Perſian</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Idol,</hi> or <hi>falſe God,</hi> and which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſignified <hi>Mercury,</hi> when the <hi>Perſians</hi> were Idolaters, ſignifies <hi>Mercury</hi> amongſt the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> as I have already remark'd. <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was the God of the Sciences, ſeems to have been adored through the whole Earth; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doubtleſs that Knowledge is one of the moſt eſſential Attributes of the true God. Remarks which may hereafter excite the curioſity of the learned men, that ſhall be deſigned to travel into the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>But I know not whether to this hour it is not lawful to believe that this is a proof of what I have ſaid,<note place="margin">It ſeems to prove that the worſhip of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> is more antient at <hi>Siam</hi> than the Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis.</hi>
                        </note> that the Anceſtors of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> muſt have adored the Heaven, like the ancient <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and as perhaps the ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> did, and that having afterwards embraced the Doctrine of the <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> and forgot the true meaning of the name of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> they have made a man of the Spirit of Heaven, and have attributed unto him all the fables that I have related. 'Tis a great Art to change the belief of the People, to leave unto them their ancient words, by cloathing them with new Idea's. Thus, it may be, that the Anceſtors of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> have thought that the Spirit of Heaven ruled the whole Nature, though the modern <hi>Siameſes</hi> do not believe it of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom:</hi> they believe on the contrary, as I have ſaid, that ſuch a care is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſupream felicity. They believe alſo that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> has ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that he has been puniſhed, at the time that he was worthy of the <hi>Nireupan,</hi> becauſe they believe the extream virtue impoſſible. They believe that the worſhip of <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> is only for them, and that amongſt the other Nations there are other men, who have render'd themſelves worthy of Altars, and which thoſe other Nations muſt adore.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Indians</hi> in general are therefore perſwaded,<note place="margin">What is the Spirit of the Faith of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or the Submiſſion which they have to their Traditions.</note> that different people muſt have different Worſhips, but by approving that other People have each their worſhip, they comprehend not that ſome would exterminate theirs. They think not like us that Faith is a Virtue: they believe becauſe they know not how to doubt; but they perſwade not themſelves that there is a Faith and Worſhip which ought to be the Faith and the Worſhip of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Their Prieſts preach not that a Soul ſhall be puniſhed in the other world, for not having believed the Traditions of his Country in this, becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not that any of them denies the Fables of their Books. They are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to believe whatever is told rhem of a foreign Religion, how incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſoever it be: but they cannot believe that their own is falſe: and much leſs can they reſolve to change their Laws, their Manners, and their Worſhip. One had better to ſhow them the contrarieties and groſs Ignorance in their Books: they do ſometimes agree herein, but for all this they reject not their Books; as for ſome falſity we reject not every Hiſtorian, nor every Phyſical Book. They believe not that their Doctrine has been dictated by an eternal and infallible Truth, of which they have not only the Idea; they believe their Doctrine born with the man, and written by ſome men, which to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have had an extraordinary knowledge, and to have led a very innocent life: but they believe not that theſe men have ever ſinned: nor that they could be ever deceived.

men, of whom they believe a thouſand Fables, which the ſuperſtition of their Anceſtors have invented in the courſe of ſeveral Ages: and this is what the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have called the Gods of the <hi>Indies.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have thought that what was honoured with a Publick Worſhip, could be only a God: and when the <hi>Indians</hi> accepted this word God for thoſe men, to the Memory of whom they conſecrate their Temples, tis that they underſtand not the force thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">That the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> proves not that they believe a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</note>There is nothing that may be taken in more various Senſes, nor which may receive more different Interpretations than exterior Worſhip.

The <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, like us, to Perſons yet living, without any deſign to make them Gods. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> do proceed further, and they not only conſecrate Statues to ſome Magiſtrates yet living, but they erect unto them ſome ſorts of Temples, and ſacred Edifices: They eſtabliſh to them a Worſhip accompanied with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, Perfumes and Lights; and they preſerve certain things of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel as Relicks: though it cannot be thought that they reſpect theſe Magiſtrates, yet living as Gods, but as men very much inferior to the King of <hi>China</hi> their Maſter, of whom they make no Divinity. There are ſeveral Chriſtian Princes which are ſerved upon the Knee, and the Deputies of the third State ſpeak to the King only in this Poſture. We give Incenſe to particular Perſons in our Churches; and the Chriſtians do honor their Princes with many and great Marks of exterior Worſhip. Thus the exterior Worſhip of the <hi>Indians</hi> is not a proof that they acknowledge, at leaſt at preſent, any Divinity; and hitherto we ought rather to call them Atheiſts than Idolaters. But when they offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to others than to God, and they joyn Vows to render themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, we cannot excuſe them of Idolatry: for in having entirely forgotten the Divinity, they only are greater Idolaters, when they terminate their Worſhip to what is not God, and that they make it the ſole Object of their Religion.</p>

For as the Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians, when God ſupported their Preaching by ſo many wonders, did not on a ſudden diſcover to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens all the Myſteries which we adore, but a long time conceal'd from them, and the Catechumens themſelves, the knowledge of thoſe which might ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them; it ſeems very rational to me, that the Miſſionaries, who have not the gift of Miracles, ought not preſently to diſcover to the Orientals, all the Myſteries nor all the Practices of Chriſtianity. 'Twould be convenient, for example, if I am not miſtaken, not to preach unto them, without gteat cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the worſhipping of Saints: and as to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, I think it would be neceſſary to manage it with them, if I may ſo ſay, and not to ſpeak to them of the Myſterie of the Incarnation, till after having convinced them of the Exiſtence of a God Creator. For what probability is there to begin with perſwading the <hi>Siameſes</hi> to remove <hi>Sommona-Codom, Pra Mogla,</hi> and <hi>Pra Saribout</hi> from the Altars, to ſet up Jeſus Chriſt, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> in their ſtead? 'Twould not perhaps be more proper to preach unto them Jeſus Chriſt crucified, till they have firſt comprehended that one may be unfortunate and innocent; and that by the rule received, even amongſt them, which is, that

the Innocent might load himſelf with the Crimes of the Guilty, it was neceſſary that a God ſhould become Man, to the end that this Man-God ſhould by a laborious life, and a ſhameful, but voluntary Death ſatisfie for all the Sins of men: but before all things it would be neceſſary to give them the true Idea of a God Creator, and juſtly provoked againſt men. The Euchariſt after this will not ſcandalize the <hi>Siameſes,</hi> as it formerly ſcandalized the Pagans of <hi>Europe:</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do believe that <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> could give his Wife and Children to the <hi>Talapoins</hi> to eat.<note place="margin">That the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture ought to be permitted to them only with Caution.</note>

                     <p>On the contrary, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are reſpectful towards their Parents even to a ſcruple, I doubt not that if the Goſpel ſhould be preſently put into their Hands, they would be ſcandalized at that place, where when ſome told J. Chriſt that his Mother and his Brethren asked after him, he anſwered in ſuch a manner, that he ſeems ſo little to regard them, that he affected not to know them. They would not be leſs offended at thoſe other myſterious words, which our divine Saviour ſpake to the young Man, who deſired time to go and bury his Parents. Let the dead, ſaith he, bury the dead. Every one knows the trouble which the <hi>Japponneſes</hi> expreſſed to St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> upon the Eternity of Damnation, not being able to believe that their dead Parents ſhould fall into ſo horrible a Misfortune, for want of having embraced Chriſtianity, which they had never heard of. It ſeems neceſſary therefore to prevent and mollifie this thought, by the means which that great Apoſtle of the <hi>Indies</hi> uſed, in firſt eſtabliſhing the Idea of an omnipotent, all-wiſe, and moſt juſt God, the Author of all good, to whom only every thing is due, and by whoſe will we owe unto Kings, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Magiſtrates, and to our Parents, the Reſpects which we owe them. Theſe Examples are ſufficient to ſhow with what precautions it is neceſſary to prepare the minds of the Orientals, to think like us, and not to be offended with moſt of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> do not leſs reſpect their Teachers than their Parents;<note place="margin">'Tis neceſſary to ſpeak to the Orientals with an eſteem of their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators.</note> and this ſentiment is ſo well eſtabliſhed amongſt them, that they chaſtiſe the Tutor to the Prince, the preſumptive Heir of the Crown, for the Faults which that Prince commits; and that there are ſome Princes, who being made Kings, have revenged their Tutors. The <hi>Indians</hi> do likewiſe greatly honour the Memory of thoſe, whom they believe to have preach'd up Virtue efficaciouſly: they are thoſe, whom they have judged worthy of their whole Worſhip; and they take Offence that we are ſcandalized thereat. Could we, ſay they, do leſs for thoſe, who have preached unto us ſo holy a Doctrine? Father <hi>Hierom Xavier,</hi> a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Jeſuit, having publiſhed at <hi>Agra</hi> a kind of Catechiſm, under the Title of the <hi>Mirrour of Truth:</hi> A <hi>Perſian</hi> of <hi>Iſpahan</hi> named <hi>Zinel Abedin</hi> wrote an anſwer thereunto, under the Title of the <hi>Mirrour repuls'd,</hi> which the Congregation <hi>de Propaganda fide</hi> thought neceſſary to have confuted: and it committed the care thereof to Father <hi>Philip Guadagnol,</hi> of the Order of the Regular Minimes. But he ſpake ſo unworthily of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that his confutation proved ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; becauſe that the Miſſion of <hi>Iſpahan</hi> dar'd never to publiſh it: and this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deſiring Father <hi>Guadagnol</hi> ſomewhat to moderate his Satyr, this good Father running into the other extream, made a Panegyrick upon <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which drew upon him a Reprimand from the Congregation <hi>de propaganda.</hi> 'Tis therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in theſe ſorts of matters to obſerve a wiſe Moderation, and to ſpeak reſpectfully, at leaſt to the <hi>Indians,</hi> of <hi>Brama, Sommona-Codom,</hi> and all the reſt, whoſe Statues are ſeen on their Altars. 'Tis neceſſary to agree with them that theſe men have had great natural lights, and intentions worthy of Praiſe; and at the ſame time to inſinuate to them, that being men, they are deceived in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things important to the eternal Salvation of Mankind, and principally in that they have not known the Creator.</p>
                     <p>But next to this Blindneſs, which it is neceſſary to demonſtrate inexcuſable,<note place="margin">That theſe Law-givers may be praiſed in ſome things.</note>
why ſhould we not praiſe the Legiſlators of the Eaſt, as well as the <hi>Greek</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, for that they have applied themſelves to inſpire into the People, what to them has appeared moſt virtuous, and moſt proper to keep them in Peace and Innocence? Why ſhould we blame them for the Fables, which a long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Ages full of Ignorance has invented upon their account, and of which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98501:83"/>
probably they have not been the Authors: conſidering that when they had ſpoken magnificently of their perſons, they had only done what is pardonable in almoſt all other Legiſlators? They have the merit of haveing known before the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſome intelligent Beings ſuperior to man, and the Immortality of the Soul.</p>

                        <note place="margin">That the Doctrine of <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Reaſons.</note>But if they have believed the <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> they have been thereto induced by apparent Reaſons. Ignoring all Creation, and eſtabliſhing moreover that a Soul cannot proceed from a Soul, and that there could not be an infinite number of Souls; they were forced to conclude that the infinite number of the living, which had ſucceeded one another in the World, during all this paſt Eternity, which they ſuppoſed that the World had already laſted; could not be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this finite number of Spirits, unleſs they had paſſed an infinite number of times from one body to another. The Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore founded on ſeveral Principles which we receive; and certainly contains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Falſity, which is the pretended Impoſſibility of the Creation.</p>

                        <note place="margin">And by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Reaſons.</note>As to the natural conſequences of this Doctrine, the Prohibition of Meats is very wholſom in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Horror of Blood would be every where uſeful.

On the other hand, the Opinion of the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> comforts men in the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Life, and fortifies them againſt the Horrors of Death, by the Hopes which it gives of reviving another time more happily: and becauſe that men are credulous in proportion to their deſires, 'tis obſerved that thoſe, who eſteem themſelves the moſt unhappy People in this Life, as Eunuchs, do ſtrongly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to this hope of another better Life, which the Doctrine of the <hi>Metempſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſis</hi> has given to good men.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The fear of the dead Parents excuſed by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Reaſons.</note>But if Error can be advantageous, what other can be ſo much as that Fear of Children for their dead Parents. <hi>Confucius</hi> makes it the only Foundation of all good Policy. And indeed it eſtabliſhes the Peace of Families, and of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: it bends men to Obedience, and renders them more ſubmiſſive to their Parents and to their Magiſtrates; it preſerves good Manners and the Laws. Theſe People comprehend not that they can ever abandon the Opinions and Cuſtoms, which they have received from their Fathers, nor avoid, if they did, the Reſentment which, in their Opinion, their Anceſtors would expreſs thereat. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Doctrine has no other Paradice, nor Hell, than this Republic of the dead, where they believe that the Soul is received at the departure out of this Life, and where it is well or ill entertained with the Souls of its Anceſtors, according to its Vertues or its Vices.</p>

                        </note>'Tis upon this conſideration, that the Lawful Kings of <hi>China</hi> have abſtained from making any Innovations on the Government.

                     <p>'Twould alſo be, I know not what Injuſtice to treat the <hi>Talapoins</hi> as Impoſtors, and intereſſed Perſons. They deceive only becauſe they are firſt deceived: they are not more cunning, nor more inteteſted than the Seculars. When they preach to the Seculars to beſtow Alms upon them, they think their Preaching their Duty; and in every Country the Miniſters of the Altar do live on the Altar.</p>
                     <p>I am therefore convinced, that the true ſecret of inſinuating into the mind of theſe People, ſuppoſing one has not the Gift of Miracles, is not directly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them in any thing, but to ſhow them, as at unawares, their Errors in the Sciences, and eſpecially in the Mathematicks and Anatomy, wherein they are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98501:83"/>
moſt palpable: 'Tis to change the Terms of their Worſhip the leaſt Imaginable, by giving to the true God, either the Name of Soveraign Lord, or that of King of Heaven and Earth, or ſome other Name which ſignifies in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country, what is moſt worthy of Veneration, as the word <hi>Pra</hi> in <hi>Siameſe:</hi> But at the ſame time it be neceſſary to inſtruct them to annex unto theſe Names the intire Idea of the Deity, an Idea ſo much the more eaſie to receive, as it only heightens and embelliſhes the mean Idea's of the falſe Gods. <hi>Gott</hi> which now ſignifies <hi>God</hi> in <hi>German,</hi> was anciently, according to <hi>Voſſius,</hi> the Name of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who ſeems to have been every where adored. Certainly the words <hi>Theos</hi> and <hi>Deus</hi> have not always ſignified in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> the God, which we adore. What then have the Chriſtians done? They have accepted theſe Names in the ſtead of the ineffable Name of God, and they have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them after their manner. From the Knowledge of an eternal, ſpiritual God and Creator, it would be eaſie to deſcend to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt: and theſe People would make no Oppoſition, if firſt they ſaw themſelves cured of ſome ſenſible Ignorance. The Spirit of man is ſuch, that he almoſt implicitly receives the Opinions of him, who has viſibly convinc'd him of his firſt Errors. Thoroughly convince a ſick perſon that the Remedy which he uſes is not good, and he will immediately take yours.</p>
                     <p>But in my opinion it is one of the moſt important Articles of the conduct of the Miſſionaries,<note place="margin">How the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries ought to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſimple cuſtoms of the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, in what concerns not Religion.</note> to accommodate themſelves entirely to the ſimplicity of the Manners of the Orientals, in their Food, Furniture, Lodging, and whatever the Rules of the <hi>Talapoins</hi> preſcribe, wherein they have nothing contrary to Chriſtianity. The example of Father <hi>de Nobilibus</hi> the Jeſuit is famous. Being in Miſſion to the Kingdom of <hi>Madura</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> he reſolved to live like a <hi>Jogue,</hi> that is to ſay, like a <hi>Bramin</hi> of the Woods; to go with his Feet naked, and his Headbare, and his Body almoſt naked, in the ſcorching Sands of this Country, and to nouriſh himſelf with that exceſs of frugality, which appear'd intollerable: and it is reported that by this means he converted near forty thouſand perſons. Now as this exact imitation of the <hi>Indian</hi> ſeverity is the true way to make ſome Converſions, ſo the further one ſhould remove therefrom, the more one ſhould attract the hatred and contempt of the <hi>Indians.</hi> It is neceſſary to learn in theſe Countries, to make a ſhift with whatever they do, and not to ſuſtain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, or rather the ſuperfluities of theſe Countries, if one would not cauſe Jealouſie and Envy to ſome Nations, the particular perſons of which conceal their fortune, becauſe they can preſerve it only by hiding. The leſs the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries appear ſettled, the more the Miſſion is eſtabliſhed, and the better it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Religion. As the Eaſt is not a Country of ſettlement for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it would be an injury to think to accompliſh it: the Natives of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do not themſelves enjoy any ſolid fortune; and they would not fail to pick quarrels with thoſe that ſhould appear richer than them, to deprive them of their Riches. Moreover, the Orientals ſeem to have no prejudice for any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and it muſt be confeſſed, that if the beauty of Chriſtianity has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd them, it is principally by reaſon of the bad opinion, which the Avarice, Treachery, Invaſions, and Tyranny of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and ſome Chriſtians in the <hi>Indies,</hi> have implanted and rivetted in them. But it is time to conclude this Relation with the Life of <hi>Thevetat,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and with all the other things that I have promiſed.</p>

                        </note>, who by his good works in proceſs of time arrived at the <hi>Nireupan,</hi> his Father, King <hi>Taouſoutout,</hi> conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Soothſayers to know what would betide him, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that a Son would have, at whoſe Nativity there had appeared ſo many Wonders. They all aſſur'd him that he had great reaſon to rejoyce, ſeeing that if his Son did continue in the World, he would be Emperor of the whole Earth; or that if he turned <hi>Talapoin,</hi> by abandoning the Pleaſures of the Age, he would arrive at the <hi>Nireupan.</hi> It is neceſſary to know that this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had ſeven ſorts of things, which were ſo peculiar to him, that there was none beſides him that had them. The firſt was a Glaſs-bowl, which he made uſe of to rid himſelf of his Enemies, by throwing it againſt thoſe whom he would kill; which being let go, went to cut off the Enemies head, and then return'd of it ſelf. The ſecond were Elephants and Horſes of an extraordinary goodneſs and beauty, which did fly with the ſame facility as they walked. The third was a piece of Glaſs, by the means of which he could have as much Gold and Silver as he pleaſed: for to this end he needed only to throw it into the Air, and of the heighth that it went, there would grow a Pillar of Gold or Silver. The fourth was a Lady, come from the North, of a marvellous Beauty, who had a great glaſs Pot ſuſtained by three Columns of the ſame: then when ſhe would boil any Rice, ſhe needed only to put never ſo little Rice therein, and the Fire would kindle of it ſelf, and extinguiſhed alſo of it ſelf when the Rice was boiled: the Rice multiplied ſo exceedingly in the boiling, that it would feed five hundred men and more. The fifth was a man, who took care of the Houſe, and who had Eyes ſo penetrating, that he did ſee Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones in the Bowels of the Earth. The ſixth was a great <hi>Mandarin</hi> of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Strength and Valour. The laſt was, that he had a Thouſand Children by one Queen, which indeed did not all come out of her Womb. One alone came out thence, and the reſt were engendered of the Water, Blood, and whatever comes out at the Delivery. Every one of theſe Children in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular being grown up, was capable of ſubduing and vanquiſhing all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which their Father could have. Now there was one of the Soothſayers, who taking the Father aſide, told him, that aſſuredly his Son would abandon the World, would quit the Kingdom, and would conſecrate himſelf to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by turning <hi>Talapoin,</hi> to be able by his good works to arrive at the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupan.</hi>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98501:87"/>His Relations, to the Number of Ten Thouſand, underſtanding by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Soothſayer, that the Univerſal Demeſne of this whole World, or the <hi>Nireupan</hi> were aſcertained to this young Prince, reſolv'd amongſt themſelves every one to give him, when he ſhould be a little advanced in years, one of their Sons to make up his Train; and ſo they did. When therefore this Prince, after the Repentance of ſome ſeven years, which he performed in the Woods, was become worthy of the <hi>Nireupan,</hi> a great many of theſe young men, whom we mentioned, which were of his Retinue, turn'd <hi>Talapoins</hi> with him; but amongſt this great Company there were ſix, who though they were his Relations, and in his Train, would not yet follow him. We will recite the Names thereof, by reaſon that in the ſequel we ſhall ſpeak only of them. The firſt is called <hi>Pattia,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Anourout,</hi> the third <hi>Aanon,</hi> the fourth <hi>Packou,</hi> the fifth <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mila,</hi> the ſixth<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Siame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> report that <hi>Thevetat</hi> was the Brother of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> by this Hiſtory he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                        <hi>Thevetat:</hi> and it is of this laſt that we wrire the Hiſtory. One day the Fathers of theſe ſix young Princes being accidentally met together, after having diſcourſed a long time about ſeveral indifferent things, one of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the reſt that not any of their Sons had followed the Prince to turn <hi>Talapoin;</hi> and they ſaid amongſt themſelves, is it becauſe that not any of our Children will turn <hi>Talapoins,</hi> that we ſhall upon this account ceaſe to be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? Hereupon therefore the Father of <hi>Anourout,</hi> one of theſe ſix young Princes, who was the Succeſſor of <hi>Taouſoutout,</hi> ſaid to his Son, that though he was of Royal Blood, yet if <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> would receive him into his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as a <hi>Talapoin,</hi> he would not hinder him, though ſome Perſons of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would not follow this Example.</p>
                     <p>Prince <hi>Anourout</hi> being accuſtomed to his Pleaſures, and to have whatever he deſired, underſtood not what this word of refuſal, <hi>No,</hi> did mean. One day as theſe ſix young Princes diverted themſelves at Bowls, and played for Confects for a Collation, <hi>Anourout</hi> having loſt, ſent a Man to his Mother, to intreat her to ſend him ſome Confects, which ſhe did: having eaten them, they played for a ſecond Collation, then a third and a fourth; and his Mother ſent him ſome Confects, till all were gone: But as <hi>Anourout</hi> ſtill ſent to have more, his Mother then told the Servant: <hi>No, there are no more.</hi> Which being related to the Son, and the Son not underſtanding what theſe words, <hi>No there are no more,</hi> did ſignify, having never heard them ſpoken, thought that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant that ſhe had yet others more excellent, the name of which muſt be theſe words, <hi>No there are no more.</hi> He therefore ſent back his Servant to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſiring her to ſend him ſome of the Confects <hi>No there are no more;</hi> his Mother perceiving hereby that her Son underſtood not theſe words, <hi>No there are no more,</hi> reſolved to explain them to him. She took a great empty Diſh, covered it with another, and gave it to the Servant to carry to her Son. But then the <hi>Genij</hi> of the City <hi>Koubilepat</hi> reflecting on all that had paſſed between Prince <hi>Anourout</hi> and his Mother, and knowing that the Prince underſtood not theſe words, <hi>No there are no more,</hi> (becauſe that formerly in another Generation he had Charitably given to the <hi>Talapoins</hi> his Portion of Rice, and had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſired, that in proceſs of time, when he ſhould come to revive again in this World, he might not underſtand what theſe words, <hi>No there are no more,</hi> did mean; neither did he underſtand or know the place where the Rice did grow) they ſaid that it was neceſſary ſpeedily to aſſemble themſelves with the other <hi>Genij,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theſe <hi>Genij</hi> are not invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and their care is to recompence and puniſh.</note> to conſult what was proper to be done, becauſe that if <hi>Anourout</hi> found the Plate empty, their head as a Puniſhment would be broke in ſeven pieces. It was therefore reſolved that they would fill it with Confects brought from Heaven, which they did. The Servant who carried the Plate, having laid it at the place, where theſe young Princes were diverting themſelves, <hi>Anourout,</hi> who only expected this to pay his Debt to his Companions, ran to the Plate and uncovered it, and found it as before, full of Confects, but ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent that the whole City was perfumed with their Odor: The excellent taſte which they found in theſe Confects, diffuſed it ſelf through their whole Body. The Plate was ſoon empty, and hereupon <hi>Anourout</hi> reflecting on the goodneſs of theſe Confects ſaid unto himſelf: It muſt needs be that my Mother has ſcarcely loved me till now, ſeeing that ſhe never gave me the Confects, <hi>No there are no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98501:87"/>
more.</hi> Returning home, he went to ask his Mother, whether ſhe loved her Son. His Mother, who paſſionately loved him, was exceedingly ſurprized at this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and anſwered him that ſhe loved him as her own Heart, and Eyes. And why, if what you ſay is true, have you never given me the Confects, <hi>No there are no more.</hi> For the future I beſeech you to give me no other: I am reſolved to eat only of theſe. His Mother, aſtoniſhed to hear her Son ſpeak thus, addreſſed her ſelf to the Servant, who had carried the Plate, and asked him ſecretly, whether he ſaw any thing therein, to whom he anſwered yes, that he ſaw the Diſh filled with a kind of Confects, which he had never ſeen before: and then the Mother of <hi>Anourout</hi> comprehended the Myſtery, and judged right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Antient Merit of her Son had procured him theſe Confects, and that the Superior <hi>Genij</hi> had rendered him this good Office. Afterwards therefore when the Prince demanded theſe Confects of his Mother, ſhe only took an empty Diſh, covered it with another, and ſent it him, and the Plate was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found full as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anourout</hi> underſtood not likewiſe the meaning of theſe words, to aſſume the <hi>Pagne</hi> or <hi>Talapoins</hi> Habit, and having one day deſired his elder Brother <hi>Pattia</hi> to explain them to him, <hi>Pattia</hi> informed him what he knew, that to aſſume the <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poins</hi> Habit, was intirely to ſhave his Hair and Beard, to ſleep on a Hurdle, and to cloath himſelf with a yellow <hi>Pagne.</hi> Which <hi>Anourout</hi> underſtanding, he told his Brother that being accuſtomed to live at his eaſe, and to have all things at pleaſure, he ſhould find much difficulty to lead this Life: And <hi>Pattia</hi> replyed, ſeeing then my Brother that you will not reſolve to turn <hi>Talapoin,</hi> conſider which is beſt: but alſo not to live Idly, learn to work and continue at my Father's Houſe as long as you pleaſe. <hi>Anourout</hi> asked him what he meant by this word to <hi>Work,</hi> which he underſtood not: <hi>Pattia</hi> then ſaid unto him, how can you know what it is to work, ſeeing that you neither know where nor how the Rice grows? One day indeed <hi>Quimila, Pattia,</hi> and <hi>Anourout</hi> diſcourſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Place where the Rice might grow, <hi>Quimila</hi> replyed that it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Barn: <hi>Pattia,</hi> ſaid no, and aſſerted that it grew in the Pot: And <hi>Anou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rout</hi> told them both that they underſtood nothing, and that it grew in the Diſh. The firſt having one day obſerved that the Rice was taken out of the Barn, thought it was there that it grew. The ſecond had ſeen it taken out of the Pot, and 'tis that which gave him occaſion to think that it grew in the Pot: But the third who had never ſeen it otherwiſe than in the Diſh, really believed that the Rice grew in the Diſh, when one had a deſire to eat: and thus all three knew nothing of the matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anourout</hi> declared afterwards to the other two that he was not inclined to work, and that he choſe rather to turn <hi>Talapoin:</hi> and he went to ask leave of his Mother. She refuſed him two or three times: but as he would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and as he continually preſſed her more and more, ſhe told him that if <hi>Pattia</hi> would turn <hi>Talapoin,</hi> ſhe would permit him to follow him. <hi>Anourout</hi> went therefore to ſollicit his five other Companions to make themſelves <hi>Talapoins,</hi> and they reſolved to do it ſeven days after. Theſe ſeven days being elapſed they went out of the City, with a great Equipage, ſeeming to go to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Country. In their retinue they had a great many <hi>Mandarins</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Elephants, with a good number of Footmen. But principally they had in their Train a Barber by Profeſſion, named <hi>Oubbali.</hi> Being atrived at the Confines of the Kingdom, they ſent back all their retinue except <hi>Oubbali:</hi> then they ſtript themſelves of their Cloaths, folded them up very neatly, and put them into the hands of <hi>Oubbali,</hi> to make him a preſent thereof, telling him that he ſhould return into the City, and that he had wherewithal to live at his eaſe the remainder of his days. <hi>Oubbali,</hi> very much afflicted to ſeparate himſelf from theſe ſix Princes, and yet not daring to contradict what they order'd him, after having taken his leave of them departed weeping, and took his road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ciry, from whence they had ſet out together. But it preſently came into his mind, that if he returned, and that the Parents of theſe young Princes ſhould ſee the cloaths of their Children, they would have reaſon to ſuſpect him of their death, and likewiſe to put him to death, not believing that theſe young
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98501:88"/>
Princes would have quitted ſuch precious Habits to give them to him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he hung up theſe Habits on a Tree, and returned to ſeek out theſe young Lords. So ſoon as they ſaw him, they demanded the reaſon of his return, and having declared it to them, he teſtified that he would continue with them, and aſſume the Habit of a <hi>Talapoin.</hi> Theſe young Princes preſented him then to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> beſeeching him to give the Habit to him, rather than to them: for finding themſelves yet full of the Spirit of the World, and proud of heart, and willing to humble themſelves, they deſired that <hi>Oubbali,</hi> who was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to them in the World, might be their Elder in Religion, to the end they might be obliged to reſpect him, and to yield to him in all things: the<note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe that this is a remark which the Tranſlator has inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Text, and we may therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark ſome other.</note> Rule, requiring that between two <hi>Talapoins</hi> the Eldeſt have all the Honours, though the youngeſt be much the more Learned. <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> granted them their Requeſt, and they aſſumed the Habit a little while after <hi>Oubbali.</hi> Being therefore entred into the time of Repentance, <hi>Pattia</hi> by his merit had a Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Heart, Eyes, and Ears; that is to ſay he underſtood every thing, he knew the Hearts of others, he ſaw all things, and heard every thing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſtance and all obſtacles. One day after <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> had preached, <hi>Anourout</hi> was advanced to the degree of an Angel. At the ſame time <hi>Aanon</hi> a <hi>Talapoin,</hi> dear to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> went to <hi>Sonda</hi> the firſt degree of Perfection. <hi>Packou</hi> and <hi>Quimila</hi> after having a long time exerciſed themſelves in Prayer and Meditation, were advanced to be Angels. There was <hi>Thevetat</hi> alone that could obtain no other thing than a great ſtrength, and the power of doing Miracles<note n="*" place="margin">The Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that he is <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetat:</hi> but it is neceſſary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to them that the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they attribute to <hi>Thevetat</hi> are to do Evil, and that thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt are for Good.</note>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sommona Codom</hi> being gone with his <hi>Talapoins</hi> to the City of <hi>Kouſampi,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants came daily to make them preſents, ſometimes to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Mogla</hi> and to <hi>Saribout,</hi> his two principal Favourites, one of which ſat on his Right hand, and the other on his Left: ſome to <hi>Kaſop</hi> and <hi>Pattia,</hi> others to <hi>Quimila</hi> and <hi>Packon,</hi> or to <hi>Anourout;</hi> but what is remarkable, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſented to <hi>Thevetat:</hi> and they ſpake no more of him than if he had never been in the world, whereat he was extreamly inraged. Is it, ſaid he, that I am not a <hi>Talapoin</hi> as well as the others? Is it that I am not of the Royal Blood like them? Why has no one made any Preſent to me? He therefore reſolved inſtantly to ſeek out ſome body that ſhould preſent him, and to allure ſome Diſciples. The King of the City <hi>Pimpiſaan,</hi> was arrived to the firſt degree of Perfection, with One Hundred and Ten Thouſand men, all Diſciples of <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom:</hi> and he had a Son as yet young, and who knew not what Evil was, <hi>Thevetat</hi> contriving to ſeduce this Son, to make uſe of him in his wicked deſigns, went from the City of <hi>Pinmeſan,</hi> to go to <hi>Rhacacreu,</hi> and aſſumed by the power he had, the ſhape of a little Infant, with a Serpent round each Leg, another round his Neck, and another round his Head. Beſides this he had one, who embracing him on the left Shoulder, deſcended underneath the right Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before and behind. In this equipage he took wing, and went through the Air to the City of <hi>Rachacreu.</hi> He lights at the Feet of <hi>Achataſatrou,</hi> who was that young Prince the Son of the King of the City of<note n="*" place="margin">Juſt before he ſaid <hi>Pimpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaan.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Pimmepiſan,</hi> and who ſeeing <hi>Thevetat</hi> after this manner, with his whole body twiſted about with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, conceived a great Terror thereat. Being affrighted at a thing ſo ſtrange, he asked <hi>Thevetat</hi> who he was, and <hi>Thevetat</hi> having told him his Name, and entirely confirmed him, re-aſſumed his firſt ſhape, that is to ſay his <hi>Talapoins</hi> Habit, and his Serpents diſappeared. <hi>Achataſatrou</hi> hereupon conceived a great eſteem of <hi>Thevetat,</hi> and made him great Preſents, an Honor which effected the ruine of <hi>Thevetat</hi> by the Pride he conceived thereat; for from that time he contrived the deſign of making himſelf Maſter and Chief of his Brethren. He went therefore to <hi>Sommona-Codom;</hi> he found him out who preached to the King, ſaluted him, approached him, and after ſome diſcourſe told him, that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a very advanced Age, it was not fit that for the future he ſhould take ſo much Pains, but that he ought to think of ſpending the reſt of his days plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly and at his own Eaſe. I am, added he, ready to aſſiſt you to the utmoſt of my power, and as the care of ſo many Religious overwhelms you, you may for the future diſcharge it upon me. This is the Language, which the extream
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98501:88"/>
deſire of ſeeing himſelf above all, did put into his Mouth. <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> who knew him, refus'd and contemn'd his demand, whereat <hi>Thevetat</hi> was ſo enraged, that he only plotted ways to revenge himſelf. He returned to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rachacreu</hi> to find out <hi>Achataſatrou</hi> his Diſciple, and perſwaded him to get rid of his Father, the ſooner to get upon the Throne, and afterwards to afford him the means of putting <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> to Death, and of ſetting up himſelf in his ſtead. <hi>Achataſatrou</hi> then cauſed his Father to be put into a Dungeon loaded with Irons, and ſeized on the Throne: <hi>Thevetat</hi> expreſſed unto him his Joy, and deſired him to remember the Promiſe he had made him. The new King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently granted him 500 men armed with Arrows, to go and kill <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> They found him walking at the Foot of a Mountain; and his ſight alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in them ſo much Fear and Reſpect, that there was not any one who dared to let fly an Arrow; they all remained immoveable, every one with their Bow bent. <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> intreated them to tell him the Author of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; and when they had informed him, he preached a Sermon unto them, at the end of which they arrived at the firſt degree of Perfection, and returned home. So ſoon as <hi>Thevetat</hi> ſaw that they had miſſed their blow, he went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Mountain, and applied himſelf to roul down Stones to the bottom, deſignedly to kill <hi>Sommona-Codom:</hi> and when he thought he had thrown down enough to kill him, he deſcended thence, and called him two or three times by his Name; <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> who had aſcended the Mountain at one ſide, when <hi>Thevetat</hi> deſcended at the other, anſwered that he was at top: <hi>Thevetat</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-mounted, and at the ſame time <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> who knew him without ſeeing him, deſcended without being ſeen. <hi>Thevetat</hi> re-aſcended again in vain, and he died with rage. Mean while <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſeeing himſelf thus perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, ſaid unto himſelf, what Crime, what Sin have I committed? Now that I am at the heighth of perfection, that I have performed ſo great a Penitence that I have preached ſo much and taught ſo holy a doctrine, yet they ceaſe not to perſecute me to kill me. And by thus examining himſelf he remember'd, that one day being drunk,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſins and is puniſhed in Hell.</note> *he had hit a <hi>Talapoin</hi> with a little ſtone which he had flung, and which had drawn out a little blood, and he knew that he was to be puniſhed in five hundred Generations ſucceſſively; that he had already been puniſhed in 499, and that this was the five hundredth: beſides which, he had been a long time in Hell. Wherefore knowing moreover that if he permitted not <hi>Thevetat</hi> to do him ſome miſchief, he ſhould kill him with rage, and go into Hell after his death, he rather choſe that a ſmall ſhiver of a Flint which <hi>Thevetat</hi> threw at him, and which daſh'd in pieces againſt another, ſhould wound him in the foot to draw out a little blood. 'Twas he that ſtretch'd out his foot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the blow, and thereby he appeaſed the anger of <hi>Thevetat,</hi> who for ſome time forgot the Reſolution of killing him.</p>
                     <p>One day as <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> went to beg Alms in the City of <hi>Rachacreu, Theve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat</hi> being advertiſed thereof, procur'd the King to ſend his moſt miſchievous Elephants to do him a miſchief, if he did not retreat. <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ceaſed not to continue his road with his <hi>Talapoins:</hi> and as they came near the Elephants, <hi>Aanon</hi> went before his Maſter, to ſecure him from the fury of the Elephants, by expoſing himſelf, but they hurt no body.</p>
                     <p>At his departure out of the City, <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> retir'd into a <hi>Pagod,</hi> where the people brought him to eat. He eat, and preached afterwards to all this multitude, which was come out to the number of Ten Millions of perſons, to hear him: and he converted fourſcore and four Thouſand, ſome of which went to the firſt degree, others to the ſecond, others to the third, others to the fourth degree of Perfection. Several enlarged themſelves on the Praiſes of <hi>Aanon,</hi> who loved his maſter ſo dearly, as to expoſe his life for him. Whereupon <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> informed them, that this was not the firſt time <hi>Aanon</hi> had done it. Another time he ſaid unto them, when I was King of the <hi>Ong</hi> ('tis a kind of Bird) <hi>Aanon</hi> being alſo an <hi>Ong,</hi> and my younger Brother, he ſaved my life by expoſing his in my place. When the King <hi>Achataſatrou</hi> had heard <hi>Aanon</hi> thus commended, for having expoſed his life for his Maſter, he recalled the 500 men, which he had given to <hi>Thevetat:</hi> and thus <hi>Thevetat</hi> ſaw himſelf abandon'd
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98501:89"/>
by every one. He had leave to beg, but no body gave him wherewith to live: being reduced to the extremity of ſeeking a livelihood himſelf, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and offered him five Propoſitions, which he intreated him to grant. The firſt was, that if there were ſome <hi>Talapoins</hi> who would oblige themſelves to live in the Woods, and ſequeſter'd from the World, he would permit them. The ſecond, that thoſe who would engage themſelves to live only on Alms, might ſubmit themſelves thereto. The third, that he would grant the liberty of cloathing themſelves poorly to ſuch who would deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to do it, and who would oblige themſelves to be always contented with old <hi>Pagnes,</hi> patched and naſty. The fourth, that he would permit thoſe which ſhould deſire it, to refuſe all their life to have any other Convent or Lodging, than under a Tree; and in fine, that they who would never eat Meat or Fiſh, might deprive themſelves thereof. <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> anſwer'd him, that it was neceſſary to leave to every one his own will, and to oblige no perſon to more than he would, or even than he could. <hi>Thevetat</hi> roſe up after <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi>'s Anſwer, and cried aloud to all the <hi>Talapoins</hi> that were preſent; let all thoſe that would be happy follow me: and immediately a Troop of ignorant perſons, to the number of five hundred, deceived by the ſpecious appearance of his falſe intentions, reſolved to follow him, and exactly to keep the five things which he propoſed. They had ſome devoto's which nouriſh'd them, and which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd all their wants: although they knew that <hi>Thevetat</hi> had kindled the War amongſt the <hi>Talopoins,</hi> by ſeparating himſelf from his Maſter. When <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſaw that he took ſo wicked a Conduct, he endeavoured to reclaim him, by divers Sermons which he made to him, to convince him that there was not a greater Crime than this. <hi>Thevetat</hi> heard him very patiently, but without making any benefit thereby: for he briskly quitted <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> On the Road he met <hi>Aanon,</hi> who demanded Charity from door to door in the City of <hi>Rachacreu,</hi> and told him that he had juſt quitted his Maſter, to live for the future after his own humor. <hi>Aanon</hi> told it to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> who repli'd, that he knew it very well, that he ſaw that <hi>Thevetat</hi> was an unhappy wretch, that he would go into Hell. This, adds he, is exactly as Sinners do; they commit great Crimes, and this they call doing Good, and what is Good they call Evil. Virtuous Men do good without trouble, whereas it is a puniſhment to the wicked; and on the contrary, Evil diſpleaſeth the Good, and the wicked make a pleaſure thereof. Knowing therefore the place and quarter where <hi>Thevetat</hi> was retir'd with his 500 Diſciples, he ſent <hi>Mogla</hi> and <hi>Saribout</hi> thither to bring them away. They found <hi>Thevetat</hi> preaching, and when he ſaw them, he thought that like him they had quitted their Maſter. Wherefore after his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he ſaid unto them: I know that when you were with <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> you were his two Favourites, and that he made you to ſit one at his right hand, and the other at his left, I deſire you to accept the ſame thing from me. Not to know him, and the better to cover their deſign, they told him that they kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted it, and ſeated themſelves indeed at his ſides. Then he intreated them to preach in his ſtead whilſt he went to repoſe. <hi>Saribout</hi> preached, and after his Sermon all thoſe 500 <hi>Talapoins</hi> arrived at the perfection of an Angel, roſe up into the Air and diſappear'd. <hi>Conkali</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Thevetat</hi> ran to wake him and tell him, what had paſt. I had well adviſed you not to truſt them, ſaid he unto him: than he began to be vexed, and to ſuch a degree, that he beat <hi>Conkali</hi> ſo as to make his Mouth to bleed. On the other hand, when the <hi>Talapoins,</hi> which were with <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> ſaw <hi>Mogla</hi> and <hi>Saribout</hi> return with their Company, they went immediately to acquaint their Maſter, and to expreſs unto him the aſtoniſhment wherein they were to ſee <hi>Mogla</hi> and <hi>Saribout</hi> return ſo well accompanied, after having ſeen them depart alone. <hi>Mogla</hi> and <hi>Saribout</hi> came alſo to ſalute their Maſter, and the new come <hi>Talapoins</hi> told <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona-Codom</hi> that <hi>Thevetat</hi> imitated him in all things. You very much deceive your ſelves, ſaid he unto them, to think that he does what I do: formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he Counterfeited me, but now he practiſes the ſame. Then his Diſciples ſaid unto him, we know our dear Maſter that <hi>Thevetat</hi> Counterfeits you at preſent, but that he has Counterfeited you in times paſt we know nothing thereof, wherefore we deſire you to explain it to us. He then open'd his mouth and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98501:89"/>
ſaid, you know that heretofore being a Bird, but a Bird which ſought his living ſometimes in the Water, ſometimes on the Land, <hi>Thevetat</hi> at the ſame time was a Land-Fowl and had great Feet. After my example he would catch Fiſh, but he entangled his Neck in the Weeds, not being able to pluck it out, and died there. I remember alſo that I once was one of theſe little red Birds, which do eat the Worms of the Trees. <hi>Thevetat</hi> was a Bird of another ſort, and he affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nouriſh himſelf like me. I ſought the Worms in the Trees, which have the heart included in the middle of the Trunck, and I ſought out theſe Trees in a great and ſpacious Foreſt, he ſought the Worms in Trees without heart, but which have an appearance thereof; and his head was bruiſed as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Another time I was born a <hi>Rachaſi,</hi> and he was born a wild Dog. Now the <hi>Rachaſi</hi> do live only on the Elephants which they kill in the Woods, and the Dog of the Woods would act like me, but he reapt the evil thereof: for the Elephants trampled him under their Feet and cruſhed him in pieces.</p>
                     <p>Another day <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> preaching to his Diſciples, ſpake to them of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetat,</hi> and ſaid unto them. Once I was one of the Land-fowl with great Feet, and he was <hi>Rachaſi.</hi> In eating of meat he would ſwallow a bone, which ſticking in his Throat would ſtrangle him. I had compaſſion on him, I drew the bone out of his Throat at the requeſt he made me, confeſſing that what force ſoever he had uſed, yet he could not relieve himſelf. I entered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into his great Throat, which he open'd, and pluck'd out this bone with my Beak: and as he had promiſed me a recompence, I only demanded of him ſomething to eat, but he anſwered me, that having permitted me to enter into his Throat, and to come out ſafe and ſound, was the greateſt Favour he could ſhow me. Another time I was a Stag, and <hi>Thevetat</hi> a Hunter. Going one day a Hunting, he climb'd upon a Tree, which bore the little Fruits which Stags do eat, and there made himſelf as it were a little Hutt, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cloſe and conceal'd in, expecting his Prey: and as the Stag<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis one of the names of <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Poutiſat</hi> was come very near the Tree, <hi>Thevetat</hi> threw him ſome Fruits to entice him to approach nearer: but the Stag <hi>Poutiſat</hi> ſeeing theſe Fruits fall on either ſide, doubted of the buſineſs, and obſerved the Hunter upon the Tree, to whom he ſaid 'twas in vain to wait longer, that he would not approach him nearer. 'Tis thus that <hi>Thevetat</hi> deſires much. Another time <hi>Thevetat</hi> was a Fiſherman. Having one day thrown his Line, the Hook catch'd on a Tree fallen into the water, he thought that the hook held a great Fiſh, and conſidering already that he muſt ſhare it among his Friends, he was troubled thereat, becauſe that theſe preſents would deprive him of the greateſt part. To prevent this inconvenience he ſent his Son whom he had with him, to carry unto his Wife the news of the prize he thought to catch, and orders to go immediately to quarrel with all her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. She then took her little dog, and repaired preſently to the neareſt, went into the houſe, and began to ſcold at him and his Wife: from thence ſhe went to another, and at laſt to them all. In the mean time <hi>Thevetat</hi> was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his Line which he could not get out, ſo that to have it he ſtript him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, laid his Cloaths on the bank of the River, threw himſelf into the water, and gave ſuch an unhappy blow againſt the Tree, that he beat out borh his Eyes. The Paſſengers ſtole away his Cloaths: and the quarrel of his Wife with his Neighbours, coſt him all the little Money he had, by a Suit which they brought againſt him for this injury. After this <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> departed out of the City of <hi>Rachacreu</hi> to go to <hi>Savati:</hi> he was there ſick in a Convent where he lodged: and at the ſame time <hi>Thevetat</hi> was likewiſe ſick of a diſtemper, which held him nine Months. He had an extream deſire to ſee his Maſter <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and he ſignified it to his diſciples, deſiring them to do him the kindneſs to carry him to him. They asked him how he dared to think thereof, and what Good and Succour he could expect from him, after having perſecuted him ſo much. 'Tis true, ſaid he unto them, that for the Good he has done me, I have only return'd him Evil; but that's no matter carry me to him, that ſufficeth me. They obeyed him, and having laid him on an Hurdle, they ſet out on the road, to ſeek out <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> As they approach'd, the Diſciples of <hi>Sommona-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ran to acquaint their Maſter, that <hi>Thevetat</hi> being ſick came to viſit him. I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98501:90"/>
know it, anſwered he, I know that he comes, but he ſhall not ſee me. Since that you refuſed him, reply'd the Diſciples, the favour he demanded of you, touching the five Articles which he deſired to obſerve, we have not hitherto ſeen him. Upon theſe words <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſaid unto them: <hi>Thevetat</hi> is a miſerable wretch, who has always followed his own capricious humour, and never took care to keep the Rule, which I have taken ſo much pains to teach him; wherefore, though he comes purpoſely to viſit me, and how good a mind ſoever he has thereunto, yet he ſhall not ſee me; becauſe he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to oppoſe me, and raiſe a diviſion among my Diſciples. As <hi>Thevetat</hi> was within a Mile of the Place, where <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> was, his Diſciples went again to advertiſe him thereof; and he ſtill told them, I know it very well, but yet <hi>Thevetat</hi> ſhall not ſee me. When <hi>Thevetat</hi> was within a half a mile of the City, the Diſciples returned to acquaint <hi>Sommona-Codom:</hi> 'Tis true, ſaid he, yet he ſhall not ſee me. When <hi>Thevetat</hi> was arrived at the Pool, which they call <hi>Bukoreni,</hi> near the place where <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> was, the <hi>Talapoins</hi> went again to <hi>Sommona Codom</hi> to tell him that he was near at hand; to which he reply'd, how near ſoever he be yet he ſhall not ſee me. <hi>Thevetat</hi> being therefore come to this Pool, his Diſciples ſet him on the ground on the bank of the water: and as he endeavoured to walk, his Feet ſunk, and entred into the Earth, and by little and little he ſunk up to the Neck, and then to the Chin. Seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this condition he began to recommend himſelf to <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> and offer himſelf to him, confeſſing that he was very perfect, very great: that he brought back Perſons ſtrayed out of the good way, as does a Groom, who takes care to beat his Horſes, to correct them when they are miſchievous: that he knew and underſtood every thing: that he was full of merit. He humbled himſelf, acknowledged the fault he had committed, and deſired pardon. Mean while <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> conſidering on this wretch, ſaid unto himſelf, Why haſt thou received him into thine houſe? Why haſt thou given him the habit? Would it not be better to let him continue in the world? But no, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he, for if he was ſetled there, he would have continued only to tranſgreſs the five<note n="†" place="margin">By this place it appears what the five Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> are.</note> Commandments, and to ſin. He would deſtroy the life of an infinite number of Animals: He would ſeize on anothers eſtate, where-ever he could entrap it: He would be permitted to run into all ſort of Impurity: He would have been a Lyar and Impoſtor: he would always be ſeen drunk, like a Beaſt: and in fine, he would never have done any good, and would never have medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Future. This is the reaſon why I have received him. After this <hi>Sommona Codom</hi> propheſied that after an hundred Thouſand<note n="*" place="margin">Perhaps it muſt be <hi>Lan,</hi> that is to ſay Ten Millions, to ſay Ten Millions of years: as in other places of the <hi>Indies Lec</hi> is taken for an Hundred Thouſand years, though <hi>Lec</hi> ſignifies ſimply an Hundred Thouſand. It is ſeen by this place how they pretend that the Souls of the wicked may purify themſelves by the force of Tranſmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alſo that the word <hi>Pout</hi> which ſignifies Mercury, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into this name of God, and I doubt not that the <hi>Bali</hi> Adjective <hi>Pouti</hi> comes from <hi>Pout,</hi> though I have ſeen the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes</hi> write theſe two words with different Letters; but they are not exact in their Orthography.</note> 
                        <hi>Kan, Thevetat</hi> ſhould be a God and be named <hi>Attiſaripothiequepout.</hi> Mean while <hi>Thevetat</hi> was buried in the Earth, and even to Hell where he is without poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, for want of having loved <hi>Sommona-Codom.</hi> His Body is the heighth of a <hi>Jod,</hi> that is to ſay, Eight Thouſand Fadom: he is in the Hell <hi>Avethi,</hi> 650 Leagues in greatneſs: on his head he has a great Iron pot all red with fire, and which came to his Shoulders: he has his Feet ſunk into the Earth up to the Ankles, and all inflamed. Moreover a great Iron Spit which reaches from the Weſt to the Eaſt, pierces through his Shoulders and comes out at his Breaſt. Another pierces him through the ſides, which comes from the South, and goes to the North, and croſſes all Hell. And another enters through his Head, and pierces him to the Feet. Now all theſe Spits do ſtick at both ends, and are thruſt a great way into the Earth. He is ſtanding, without being able to ſtir, or lye down. The diſciples of <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> diſcourſed amongſt themſelves of the poor <hi>Thevetat,</hi> ſaying, that he was able to come only to the lake <hi>Bukoreni,</hi> and not to the Convent, which is near it: And <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> taking up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, told them, that this was not the firſt time that ſuch a puniſhment had happen'd to <hi>Thevetat,</hi> to be ſwallow'd up and buried in Hell. I remember, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued he, that <hi>Thevetat</hi> in one of his Generations was an Hunter, and that then I was an Elephant of the Woods. One day then as he was hunting, and as he wandered and was loſt, not knowing where he was, I ſeeing him in ſo great an affliction had Compaſſion upon him, I took him upon my back, drew him out of the Woods, ſet him down near his Houſe, and then returned. Going

another time a hunting, as he ſaw me with very excellent Teeth, it came into his mind, that if he had ſuch, he could ſell them very well, and hereupon he cut off the two ends of mine. Having ſwallow'd the Silver that he had made thereof, he return'd to cut off as much more, and a third time he made an end of cutting what remain'd. I was extreamly afflicted thereat, and expreſſed all the reſentments whereof I was capable: but he carry'd not his crime very far, for as he left me, the earth open'd and ſwallow'd him up, without giving him time to ask pardon. Upon theſe words of <hi>Sommona-Codom,</hi> every one rejoiced at <hi>Thevetat</hi>'s death: And <hi>Sommona-Codom</hi> ſaid likewiſe, I remember that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Thevetat</hi> was born King of the City of <hi>Paranaſi.</hi> His name was <hi>Pingquelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi> He ſo tormented his Subjects that not one of them loved him: on the contrary every one deſired to ſee him dead: and his death happen'd when he leaſt expected it. Every one made publick rejoycings, except the Porter of the City, who wept heartily: and being demanded the reaſon thereof: Ah! ſaid he, I weep becauſe that this wretch, wicked as he is, will torment the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as he has tormented us, and the Devils not being able to bear him, will reſtore him to us, and we ſhall be as miſerable as before.

After the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have ſwept it, they go to tell it to the Maſter, who anſwers them that they have done well: then they acquaint him that they have lighted the Lamps, and the Maſter replys that it was not neceſſary ſeeing that the Sun ſhines, and it is broad day.

It is neceſſary to know and to tell in what Seaſon of the Year it is. 3. To count the number of the Auditors. 4. To inſtruct. Begin then, if you pleaſe with the firſt of theſe four things.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who goes daily to beg Alms at the ſame place, ſins.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who cauſes a Baſon to be made of Gold or Silver, to receive Alms, ſins. <hi>They receive Alms in an Iron Plate.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who pounds Rice himſelf, winnows it, and cleanſes it, or who takes Water to boil it, ſins. To be a Servant to Sin, is Sin.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who takes Wood, or any thing elſe to make a Fire, in a place where ſome Animal uſes to take his repoſe, ſins. <hi>In the expreſſion of this Precept there is ſomething of the Genius of the</hi> Siameſe <hi>tongue, for this Precept does not intimate that the</hi> Talapoin <hi>may for any reaſon whatever, take Wood in a place, where any Animal has uſed to take his repoſe, nor that he may kindle a Fire with any Wood whatever; but the meaning of the Precept is, that it is a double Fault to make the Fire, and take the Wood in a place, where ſome Animal has choſen his Lodging.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who going to beg Alms coughs, to the end that he may be ſeen, ſins. <hi>He ſins likewiſe as often as he coughs to attract the Eyes of others, though it be not in going to crave Alms.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Talapoin</hi> who walking in the Streets, covers his Head with his <hi>Pagne,</hi> or puts on a Hat, as do ſometimes the Seculars, ſins. <hi>The</hi> Talapoins <hi>ſhelter themſelves from the Sun with their Fan, in form of a Screen, which they call</hi> Talapat.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Twelve Fingers breadth do make a <hi>Keub,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Palm,</hi> or the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Thumb and the middle Finger.</p>
                     <p>Two <hi>Keub</hi> do make a <hi>Sok,</hi> that is to ſay, from the Elbow to the ends of the Fingers.</p>

                     <p>Two <hi>Kens</hi> make a Fadom, which they call <hi>Voua,</hi> and which is near an Inch leſs than our Toiſe; ſo that within a very little their eight Grains of Rice, which do make their <hi>Fingers bredth,</hi> do amount to 9 of our Lines, which we eſteem equal to 9 Barly Corns.</p>
                     <p>Twenty <hi>Voua</hi> do make a Cord, which they call <hi>Sen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And an hundred <hi>Sens,</hi> that is to ſay an hundred Cords, do make one of their Leagues, which amounts to two Thouſand Fadom. They call their League <hi>roe neng,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Hundred, roe</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Hundred,</hi> and <hi>neng</hi> ſignifies <hi>One.</hi> Thus the <hi>Italians</hi> do ſay a Thouſand.</p>
                     <p>In a word, four of their Leagues, or 8000 <hi>Voua</hi> or <hi>Fadom,</hi> do make a <hi>Jod.</hi> And theſe are all their Meaſures of Lengths.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Weights and Moneys.</note>The Names and Values of the Weights and Moneys together are theſe. 'Tis true that ſome of theſe names do not ſignifie the Moneys, but the Values or the Sums; as in <hi>France,</hi> the word <hi>Livre</hi> ſignifies not a Money, but the value of a pound weight of Copper, which is a Sum of Twenty <hi>Sols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pic</hi> is worth Fifty <hi>Catis.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tical</hi> is a Silver Coin, and is worth four <hi>Mayons,</hi> and it is the weight of half an Ounce, by reaſon of which the <hi>Cati</hi> weighs two pounds and a half.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mayon</hi> is a Silver Coin, and is worth two <hi>Fouangs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fouang</hi> is alſo a Silver Money, and is worth four <hi>Payes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Paye</hi> is not a Coin, and it is worth two <hi>Clams.</hi> But the <hi>Song-Paye,</hi> that is to ſay the two <hi>Payes,</hi> are a Silver Coin, which is worth half a <hi>Fouang.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clam</hi> likewiſe is not a Coin, but it is thought to weigh twelve Grains of Rice. This is what was told me, and upon this ground the <hi>Tical</hi> ſhould weigh 768 grains of whole Rice, which I have not tryed.</p>
                     <p>All theſe names are not <hi>Siameſe,</hi> but common amongſt the <hi>Europeans</hi> which are at <hi>Siam.</hi> I know not of what Tongue the word <hi>Pic</hi> is.

                     <p>The word <hi>Cati</hi> is <hi>Chineſe,</hi> and is called <hi>Schang</hi> in <hi>Siameſe,</hi> but the <hi>Chineſe Cati</hi> is worth two <hi>Siameſe Cati's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teil,</hi> or as others do write <hi>Tael,</hi> is alſo a <hi>Chineſe</hi> word, which is called <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> in <hi>Siameſe,</hi> but the <hi>Siameſe Cati</hi> is worth but eight <hi>Chineſe Taels,</hi> whereas it is worth twenty <hi>Siameſe,</hi> as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tical</hi> and <hi>Mayon</hi> are words the Origine of which I am Ignorant of, and which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call <hi>Baat</hi> and <hi>Seling. Fouang, Paye</hi> and <hi>Clam</hi> are of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>As to the Agreement of this Money with ours, to take it vulgarly, and without this exactneſs, which is not neceſſary to Commerce, a <hi>Baat</hi> or <hi>Tical,</hi> although it weighs only half a Crown, yet it is worth Thirty ſeven Sols and a half of our Money, by reaſon of which a <hi>Cati</hi> is worth Fifty Crowns.</p>

Abraham Roger</hi> in his <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Bramines</hi> has given us the names of the Days in <hi>Samſcortam,</hi> which, ſaith he, is the learned Language of the <hi>Bramines</hi> of <hi>Paliacata</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel.</hi> They are taken alſo from the Planets. <hi>Suriawaram</hi> Sunday, <hi>Jendrawaram</hi> Munday, <hi>Angaracawaram</hi> Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Buttawaram</hi> Wedneſday, <hi>Brahaſpitawaram</hi> Thurſday, <hi>Succrawaram</hi> Friday, <hi>Senniwaram</hi> Saturday. It is evident that <hi>Waram</hi> ſignifies Day, that <hi>Suria</hi> is the name of the Sun, perhaps with ſome inflection to denote the Genitive; and that <hi>Jendra</hi> is the name of the <hi>Moon,</hi> perhaps alſo with ſome inflection, which being taken away, would leave ſome reſemblance between this word, and the <hi>Bali Tchan.</hi> As to the other names, <hi>Angaraca</hi> participates enough of <hi>Angkaan: Butta,</hi> which it is neceſſary to pronounce <hi>Boutta,</hi> is no other than <hi>Pout: Prahat</hi> agrees with the beginning of <hi>Brahaſpita,</hi> and <hi>Succra</hi> and <hi>Souc</hi> are the ſame word. <hi>Senni</hi> and <hi>Saou</hi> appear more remote, and <hi>Suria</hi> and <hi>Athit</hi> have nothing common: but what the ſame Author adds, is remarkable, that Sunday is called <hi>Aditawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> in the vulgar Language of <hi>Paliacata:</hi> for it is there that we do again find the <hi>Baly</hi> word <hi>Athit.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Chineſe,</hi> according to Father <hi>Martinius</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Sinica,</hi> p. 31. do not name the Days by the Planets, but by the ſixty names, which they give to the ſixty Years of every Cycle: ſo that their Week, ſo to explain my ſelf, is a Revolution of ſixty Days.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Siameſe</hi> People underſtand not the Words <hi>Ai</hi> and <hi>Tgii,</hi> which are the names of the two firſt Months; but it is probable that theſe are two old nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Words, which ſignifie <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two;</hi> and this is evident from the Word <hi>Tgii,</hi> becauſe that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do ſay <hi>Tgii-Sib,</hi> to ſignifie Twenty, which <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> is two Tens. All the other names of Months are ſtill in uſe to ſignifie Numbers, with this difference, that when they are put before the Subſtantive, they ſignifie pure Numbers; and that when they are plac'd after, they become Names, which denote Order. Thus <hi>Sam Deuan</hi> ſignifies Three Months, and <hi>Deuan Sam,</hi> the Third Month.</p>

                     <p>Moſt of theſe Names are alſo of the <hi>Balie</hi> Tongue. Now as the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do make uſe of the Cycle of Sixty Years, they ought to have Sixty Names to name the Sixty Years of every Cycle; and yet the Perſons, whom I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, could give me no more than Twelve, which are repeated five times in every Cycle, to arrive at the Number of Sixty: But I doubt not that it is with ſome additions, which do make the differences thereof; and I think to find the proof thereof in two dates of <hi>Siameſe</hi> Letters, which I have carefully taken from the Originals. The firſt is thus: <hi>In the Firſt Month, the Ninth Day after the Full Moon in the</hi> Aera 2229, <hi>the Year</hi> Tchlou Sapſoc. And the ſecond is thus: <hi>The Eighth Month, and the Firſt Day of the Moon's Decreaſe in the Year</hi> Pii Tho Sapſoc <hi>of the</hi> Aera 2231. The Word <hi>Aera</hi> in theſe two dates ſimply ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Year,</hi> according to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> language; ſo that it is all one to ſay the <hi>Aera</hi> 2229, and to ſay the Year <hi>Tchlou Sapſoc:</hi> to ſay the <hi>Aera</hi> 2231, and to ſay the Year <hi>Pii Tho Sapſoc.</hi> Beſides, as the Word <hi>Pii</hi> ſignifies Year, they might put <hi>Tho Sapſoc</hi> inſtead of <hi>Pii Tho Sapſoc,</hi> as they have put <hi>Tchlou Sapſoc,</hi> and not <hi>Pii Tchlou Sapſoc.</hi> Now theſe two Years which are the Years 1685, and 1687 of Jeſus Chriſt, are not called ſimply either by <hi>Tchlou</hi> and <hi>Tho,</hi> that is to ſay of the <hi>Lizard</hi> and <hi>Goat;</hi> but to the Words <hi>Tchlou</hi> and <hi>Tho,</hi> is added the Word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc,</hi> which I underſtand not, and which was added to the Names of the Twelfth of the Years, which run then to diſtinguiſh it from the four other Twelfths of the Years of the ſame Cycle.</p>

                     <head>Of the Monſons and Tides of the Gulph of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE find upon our Seas, that tho' the Winds be very variable, yet they change with this almoſt infallible Rule, of paſſing from the North to the South only by the Eaſt; or from the South to the North, only by the Weſt; or from the Eaſt to the Weſt, only by the South; or from the Weſt to the Eaſt, only by the North. So that the Wind continually veers about the Heaven, paſſing from the North to the Eaſt, and from the Eaſt to the South; and from the South to the Weſt, and from the Weſt to the North; and almoſt never in the contrary manner: Yet in the temperate Zone, which is on the South of the Line, when we navigated thoſe Seas which are on the Eaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> we experimented in our return from <hi>Siam,</hi> that the Winds went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contrary to this Rule; but to aſſert whether this may be always ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more than one Proof. However it be, the Wind goes not ſo in the Gulph of <hi>Siam,</hi> but it only encompaſſes the Heaven in a year; whereas on our Seas it does it in a ſmall number of days, and ſometimes in one day. When in the <hi>Indies</hi> the Wind blows round the Compaſs in a day, it is ſtormy: This is what they properly call a Hurricane.</p>
                     <p>In the Months of <hi>March, April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> the South-wind prevails at <hi>Siam,</hi> the Heaven is diſorder'd, the Rains begin, and are very frequent in <hi>April.</hi> In <hi>June</hi> they are almoſt continual, and the Winds do turn to the Weſt, that is to ſay, do blow from the Weſt and the South. In <hi>July, August,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> the Winds are in the Weſt, or almoſt Weſt, and always accompany'd with Rains, the Waters overflowing the Earth to the breadth of nine or ten Miles, and above One hundred and fifty to the North of the Gulph.</p>
                     <p>During this time, and eſpecially towards the middle of <hi>July,</hi> the Tides are ſo ſtrong, that they aſcend up to <hi>Siam,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>Louvo;</hi> and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in twenty four hours with that meaſure, that the Water becomes ſweet again before <hi>Bancock</hi> in an hour; tho' <hi>Bancock</hi> be ſeven Miles from the mouth of the River, yet the Water is always ſomewhat brackiſh.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>October</hi> the Winds do blow from the Weſt and the North, and the Rains do ceaſe. In <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December</hi> the Winds are North, do clear the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſeem ſo exceedingly to lower the Sea, that in few days it receives all the Waters of the Inundation. Then the Tides are ſo inſenſible, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is always ſweet two or three Leagues in the River, and that at certain hours of the day, it is the ſame for a League in the Road. But at <hi>Siam</hi> there never is more than an Ebb and Floud in twenty four hours. In <hi>January</hi> the Winds have already turn'd to the Eaſt, and in <hi>February</hi> they blow from the Eaſt and the South.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a conſiderable Circumſtance, that at the time when the Winds are in the Weſt, or that they blow from the Weſt, the Currents of the Gulph do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly carry the Ships on the Eaſtern Coaſt, which is that of <hi>Camboya,</hi> and do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from coming back again; and that at the time when the Winds are to the Eaſt, or that they blow from the Eaſt, the Currents do run on the Weſtern Coaſt, ſo that then in Sailing it is neceſſary to fear being bore away. Now this proves, in my opinion, that the Winds have a great ſhare in the motions of the Sea, foraſmuch as ſome have proved, that theſe Currents are only in the upper parts of the Waters, and that underneath they have a quite contrary Current, becauſe that the upper Waters being continually rowled on the Shore, returns underneath towards the Coaſt from whence it came. After the ſame manner it ſeems that they are the South-winds, which drive on the Flux, and maintain it for ſix Months further up in the River, and that they are the North-winds which do hinder it the entrance of the River for the ſix other Months.</p>

                     <head>A Deſcription of the principal Fruits of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Figs of <hi>India,</hi> which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call <hi>Clouey-ngouan-tchang,</hi> Elephant's Trunks, have not the taſte of our Figs, and, in my mind, they are not ſo good. Thus the Melons of <hi>Siam</hi> are not true Melons, but the Fruit of a Tree known in the Iſles of <hi>America</hi> under the name of <hi>Papayer.</hi> I have not eaten of this Fruit. But to return to the Fig, it is of the ſize and ſhape of a Sauſage. Its green Skin, which waxes yellow and ſpotted with black in its maturity, is eaſily ſeparated from its ſoft and clammy pulp, and 'tis that which has given it the name of Fig; but in the midſt of its pulp there is no vacuity, nor any of thoſe kernels which do make as it were a little gravel in our Figs, when they are a little dry'd. Its taſte is ſtrong, and it has ſomething of ſharpneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bananas,</hi> which the <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call <hi>Clouey-ngaa-tchang,</hi> or Elephant's Tooth, is almoſt the ſame thing as the Fig, ſave that it is greener and longer, and that it has Angles, and Faces or flat Sides, which are re-united point-wiſe at both ends. Theſe Fruits do hang like Noſegays, or rather like great Bunches of Grapes, from the top of the Trunk of the Trees which bear them. The Figs grow hard in the Fire, the <hi>Bananas</hi> which are not altogether ſo delicate raw, do wax ſoft again, do there loſe their ſweetneſs, and do acquire the taſte of our Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins ripen'd on the Apple Tree.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Goyaye</hi> (in <hi>Siameſe Louc-Kiac, Louc</hi> ſignifies <hi>Son, Kiac</hi> is the name of the <hi>Goyavier</hi>) is about the ſize of a middling Apple. Its Skin is of a grayiſh green, like that of certain Pears: under this Skin is a pulp of the conſiſtence of that of the Citron, but not ſo white. When it is put into the mouth, it ſavors the Strawberry; but this Strawberry taſte ſoon loſes itſelf, becauſe it becomes too ſtrong. This pulp, which exceeds not the thickneſs of a Crown-piece, contains a liquid ſubſtance like Broth, but grayiſh, and which would not be leſs pleaſant to eat than the pulp, if it was not mix'd with an innumerable number of ſmall kernels ſo hard, that it would be difficult to chew them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jacques,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Ca-noun,</hi> are of the ſhape of a great Melon ill rounded. Under a grayiſh Skin faſhioned like Chagrin, they have a very great number of kernels, or ſtones; ſtones, if we conſider their magnitude, which is almoſt like a Pigeon's Egg: kernels, by the thin and ſmooth wood which incloſes them. Theſe ſtones therefore or kernels being broil'd or boil'd, differ not from our Cheſtnuts either in taſte or conſiſtence, excepting that they are, in my opinion, more delicate. At one end they ſtick to a pulp which invelops them all, and ſeparates them one from the other. It is eaſily torn off, according to the courſe of its fibres; it is yellow, juicy, clammy, and glutinous, of a ſweet taſte, and ſtrong ſmell. It is not poſſible to chew it, they only ſuck it.</p>
                     <p>They gave us a Fruit like to Plums, and we at the firſt appearance were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It had the pulp and taſte of a Medler, and ſometimes two, ſometimes three ſtones, but bigger, flatter, and ſmoother, than the Medler has them. This Fruit is called <hi>Mouſſida</hi> in <hi>Siameſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ox-heart</hi> was ſo named by reaſon of its ſize and ſhape. The Skin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is thin, and this Fruit is ſoft, becauſe that on the inſide it is only a kind of white Cream, and of a very agreeable taſte. The <hi>Siameſes</hi> do call it <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cout.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Durion,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Tourrion,</hi> which is a Fruit very much eſteem'd in the <hi>Indies,</hi> appear'd inſupportable to me for its ill ſmell. This Fruit is of the ſize of our Melons cover'd with a prickly Coat like our Cheſtnuts. It has alſo, like the <hi>Jacques,</hi> ſeveral ſtones, but as big as Eggs, in which is contained what they eat, in the inſide of which there is alſo another ſtone. The fewer there is of theſe ſtones in a <hi>Durion,</hi> the more pleaſant the Fruit is. There never is leſs than three.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mango,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Ma-mouan,</hi> participates at firſt of the taſte of the Peach
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98501:99"/>
and the Apricot; toward the end this taſte waxes ſtronger, and leſs agreeable. The <hi>Mango's</hi> are highly eſteem'd, I have ſeen ſome as big as a Child's hand, they are flat and oval, but pointed at the two ends almoſt like our Almonds. Their Skin is of the conſiſtence of that of our Peaches, of colour inclining to yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but their meat is only a pulp which muſt be ſuck'd, and which quits not a great flat ſtone which it envelops.</p>
                     <p>I have not ſeen the <hi>Mangouſtan,</hi> which is ſaid to be much better than the <hi>Mango's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſes</hi> have ſome ſharp Fruits which quench the thirſt, and which upon this account appear'd unto me the moſt agreeable of all. They are ſmall as Plums, and have a ſtone encompaſt with a white pulp, which eaſily melts in the mouth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tamarinde</hi> is alſo ſharp. 'Tis a Fruit encloſed in a ſhell like an Almond, and then ſeveral of theſe Fruits are likewiſe included in a Cod. I preſerved ſome, and found the Syrup thereof very pleaſant during my return; but by little and little it loſt its ſharpneſs, and there remain'd only the taſte of the Pimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. The Tree which bears it, and which is very large, has a Leaf reſembling Pimpernel.</p>
                     <p>From this Country I brought ſeveral ſorts of liquid Sweet-meats, which were come from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Siam</hi> about two years, and they ceaſed not to keep very well to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Syrup eſpecially was very good, and had nothing of Candy, notwithſtanding the heat of the Climats through which it had paſſed. Theſe Sweet-meats had perhaps been made with Sugar-candy, whith is the ſole Purifier that the Orientals have. I refer my ſelf to the Confectioners.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not of the Sugar-canes wherewith <hi>Siam</hi> abounds, nor of the Pepper, becauſe I ſaw none thereof. The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> they ſay, has cauſed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand thereof to be planted. 'Tis a Plant which needs Props like the Vine, and the Pepper hangs thereon alſo by little Bunches, like to thoſe of Currents.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ananas,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Saparot,</hi> has the meat white, and the taſte of our Peaches. Its meat is mixed with a little wood, not a wood which ſeparates, as there is in our Nuts, but with a wood that adheres thereto, and which is only the meat over-hardned; and it is at the Center that it begins to grow hard. The <hi>Ananas</hi> is believed unwholſom, becauſe that its juice, they ſay, corrodes Iron. It is yellow when it is ripe, and then to ſmell it without opening it, it has the ſcent of a roaſted Apple. Its Figure is like a great Pine Apple, it has little rindes curiouſly ranged, under which, to behold them, one would think that the kernels are. The Plant which produces it bears it at the top of its ſtalk, which is not three foot high. The <hi>Ananas</hi> keeps directly upon the little end; and at the great end there is a tuft of Leaves, like little Corn-flags, ſhort, bent outwards, and toothed. Sometimes from the body of this Fruit, and at the ſides, there grows like Wens, one or two other little <hi>Ananas,</hi> which have alſo their Tufts. Now every Tuft cut and put in the ground, may produce another <hi>Ananas,</hi> but every Plant bears only one, and bears no more than once.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coco,</hi> in <hi>Siameſe Ma-praou,</hi> is a kind of Filbert, but much bigger indeed than a Filbert, as may be ſeen by thoſe Cups of <hi>Coco</hi> which they ſell us. 'Tis the wood thereof which is naturally cover'd like that of our Nuts, with a <hi>brou</hi> or green bark an inch thick, and full of fibres, whereof Cordages may be made. In the wood of the <hi>Coco</hi> is a very pleaſant liquor, and the wood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſo full, that it ſpurts a great way when it is pierced. As this Fruit ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, this liquor congeals at the extremities, that is to ſay near the wood, and there forms a Nut very white, and of a very good taſte; the water which is not yet congealed remains ſtill at the Center of the Fruit, and at length it all congeals.</p>

                     <head>Of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi> Languages.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Siameſe</hi> Tongue has Thirty ſeven Letters, and the <hi>Baly</hi> Thirty three, but they are all Conſonants. As to the Vowels and Dipthongs, of which there is a great number in the one and the other Language, they have indeed ſome particular Characters, whereof are made other Alphabets: but of theſe Characters ſome are placed always before the Conſonant, ſome others always after, others above, others underneath: and yet all theſe Vowels, and all theſe Dipthongs thus variouſly diſpoſed in reſpect of the Conſonant, muſt only be pronounced after it.</p>
                     <p>But if in the Pronunciation the Syllable begins with a Vowel, or with a Dipthong, or if it is only a pure Vowel, or a pure Dipthong, then they have a mute Character, which ſupplys the place of a Conſonant, and which muſt not be pronounced.</p>
                     <p>This mute Character is the laſt in the two Alphabets, the <hi>Siameſe</hi> and <hi>Balie.</hi> In the <hi>Siameſe</hi> it has the figure of our <hi>o,</hi> and indeed it countervails an <hi>o,</hi> when it muſt be pronounced, and not be a mute Conſonant, that is to ſay, when it is preceeded with a Conſonant or by it ſelf. In the <hi>Balie</hi> Alphabet this laſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter countervails <hi>ang,</hi> when it is not a mute Conſonant; but its figure has no reſemblance to any one of our Letters. Thus the firſt Letter of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet, which is <hi>Aleph,</hi> ſerves as a mute Conſonant, in relation to which they place the Points which are the Vowels; and it is probable that the <hi>Aleph</hi> was anciently pronounced like the <hi>Alpha</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which has taken its name from the <hi>Aleph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Siameſe</hi> Pronunciations are very difficult for us to imitate, and they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond ſo ill to moſt of ours, that of ten <hi>Siameſe</hi> words written in <hi>French</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and read by a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> there will not perhaps be one, that is known and underſtood by a natural <hi>Siameſe,</hi> what care ſoever is taken to accommodate our Orthography to their Pronounciation.</p>
                     <p>They have the <hi>r,</hi> which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have not. They have our <hi>v</hi> Conſonant, but they pronounce it frequently like the <hi>w</hi> of the <hi>High-Germans,</hi> and ſometime like the <hi>w</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They have likewiſe the <hi>ng</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi> which we have not: For the <hi>Germans</hi> pronounce <hi>Engel,</hi> for example, after a manner that we hardly apprehend, and which is only a <hi>g</hi> pronounc'd before the <hi>e,</hi> and the <hi>i</hi> as before the <hi>a,</hi> but very ſoftly and much through the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>They have a middle Pronunciation between our two Pronunciations of <hi>yo</hi> and <hi>jo,</hi> and from hence it is that the <hi>Europeans</hi> do ſay ſometimes <hi>Camboja,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Camboya,</hi> becauſe they know not how to pronounce theſe ſorts of words exactly after the <hi>Siameſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis the ſame as to the word <hi>Kiai,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>Heart.</hi> It is not known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they rather ſay <hi>Kiai</hi> than <hi>Ciai,</hi> pronounced after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, becauſe that indeed they do not exactly ſpeak either the one or the other, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which partakes of the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>They have our Aſpiration, which yet they pronounce very ſoftly, and when they put the Character thereof before a Conſonant (which the <hi>French</hi> tongue never permits) they do it only to weaken the pronunciation of the Conſonant: and in general they ſpeak ſo ſoftly, that it is not known often whether they pronounce an <hi>m</hi> or a <hi>b, tio</hi> or <hi>tchio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have not our <hi>u</hi> Vowel which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have, but they have our <hi>e,</hi> ſuch as we pronounce it in our Monoſyllables, <hi>ce, le, me, que, ſe, te:</hi> but this <hi>e</hi> ſuffers no eliſion in their Tongue as in ours. I dare even affirm that they have no other <hi>e</hi> than this, not in the Cries of the Pagayeurs, <hi>ho, he, he,</hi> which they pronounce as we would pronounce <hi>ho, heu, heu;</hi> nor in the Syllables which end with a Conſonant, like this, <hi>Pet,</hi> which ſignifies a rough Diamond, and which they rather pronounce <hi>peut,</hi> than <hi>pet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have an <hi>a</hi> extreamly ſhort, which they write with two points, thus:, and which they pronounce clearly at the end of the words, as in this <hi>Balie</hi>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98501:100"/>
word <hi>Pra,</hi> which they give to whatever they honour moſt; but when this <hi>a</hi> is found in the middle of a word, it paſſes ſo quick that it is not diſcerned, and that it anſwers to our <hi>e</hi> mute. Hence it is that the word <hi>Pa-ya,</hi> which we have tranſlated by that of Prince, and of which the firſt <hi>a</hi> written with the two points, is pronounced <hi>Pe-ya,</hi> or <hi>Pia,</hi> though in the Relations we find it written <hi>Peja</hi> and <hi>Puja,</hi> by the confuſion of the <hi>e</hi> mute with the <hi>u,</hi> and of the <hi>y</hi> with the <hi>j</hi> conſonant. This <hi>a</hi> marked with two points ſuffers no other Letter after it in the ſame Syllable.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a thing very ſingular that in the Syllables which end with a Conſonant, they pronounce it not after our manner: but their tongue remains fix'd either to the palate of the Mouth, or to the Teeth, according to the nature of the Conſonant; or rather their Lips remain ſhut: and it is thus that they termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate theſe ſorts of pronunciations, I mean without unlooſing the Tongue, and opening the Lips again. They cannot pronounce an Aſpirate at the end of a Syllable, was it in the middle of a word. They pronounce <hi>Petpayatong,</hi> though they write <hi>Petchpayatong.</hi> The Convent of the Palace they call <hi>vat Si-Sarapet,</hi> though they write <hi>Sarapetch.</hi> Thus when they would ſay <hi>un oeuf</hi> they ſaid <hi>un oeub,</hi> but they open'd not their Lips again to finiſh after our manner the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the <hi>b.</hi> By the ſame reaſon they will pronounce an <hi>n</hi> for an <hi>r</hi> and for an <hi>l,</hi> at the end of a word, becauſe that at the end of the words they unlooſe not the Tongue from the Palate, and it is neceſſary to unlooſe it in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the <hi>r</hi> or of the <hi>l:</hi> for in that of the <hi>l,</hi> the Tongue cleaves not to the Palate at ſides. They will write <hi>Tahar</hi> and <hi>Mar,</hi> and they will ſay <hi>Tahan</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have a great deal of Accent, like the <hi>Chineſes:</hi> they do almoſt ſing in ſpeaking: and the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Alphabet begins with ſix different Characters, which do all countervail only a <hi>K,</hi> more or leſs ſtrong, and variouſly accented. For though in the pronunciation the Accents be naturally upon Vowels, yet they do mark ſome by varying the Conſonants, which otherwiſe are of the ſame weight. From whence it is perhaps permitted to conjecture that they writ at firſt without Vowels, like the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that at laſt they have marked them by ſome ſtrokes foreign to their Alphabet: and which for the moſt part are placed out of the rank of the Letters, like the Points, which the modern <hi>Hebrews</hi> have added to their ancient manner of writing. Whoever therefore has learn'd to give the true Accent to the ſix firſt Characters of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Alphabet, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounces the reſt; becauſe that they are all ranged with that art, that in their pronunciation it is neceſſary to repeat almoſt the ſame Accents. They read the <hi>Balie</hi> Alphabet after the ſame manner, ſave that they give it only five Accents, which they repeat five times in the twenty five firſt letters, the eight laſt having no accent. And as far as I can judge of the Hanſcrit by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, which Father <hi>Kirker</hi> has given us thereof in his <hi>China Illuſtrata,</hi> this Tongue, which is the learned Tongue of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s States, has five Accents like the <hi>Balie</hi> Tongue: for the Characters of its Alphabet are divided by fives.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Ngo</hi> is pronounced before all the Vowels, like our <hi>g</hi> before the <hi>a,</hi> the <hi>p</hi> and the <hi>u;</hi> with this difference, that it is pronounced a great deal more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly, and altogether from the Noſe, which gives it ſomething of <hi>n</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of its pronunciation. At the end of the words, it is pronounced without looſing the Tongue from the roof of the Mouth: they will ſay <hi>Tong,</hi> and not <hi>Tongue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The three firſt Letters of the ſecond diviſion are pronounced between the <hi>quio</hi> and <hi>cio</hi> of the <hi>Italians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>ço</hi> is pronounced after the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> manner by liſping.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>do</hi> which is in the third diviſion, is pronounced like a <hi>to</hi> at the end of words, and they have no other <hi>to</hi> final.</p>
                     <p>They have a double <hi>yo,</hi> the one at the ſecond diviſion and the other at the fifth: they pronounce them between our <hi>yo</hi> and our <hi>jo,</hi> and there is no other difference between theſe two Letters, ſave that the laſt <hi>yo</hi> which is that of the fifth diviſion, is the true <hi>yo</hi> final: they place it after the Vowels to make <hi>Dipthongs,</hi> though they ceaſe not ſometimes to place the other there, but through ignorance: for this Orthography is not in their Alphabet, where all their Dipthongs are. Now theſe <hi>yo</hi> are however thought Conſonants, as the <hi>i</hi> is thought a Conſonant in <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in theſe Dipthongs <hi>ja, je, jo, ju,</hi> with which a Vowel which preceeds them in Verſes, is not confounded, but makes its Syllable apart. And yet though the <hi>Siameſes</hi> put the <hi>yo</hi> among the Conſonants, they ſo clearly perceive that they ſound like Vowels, that in writing the words, which begin with a <hi>yo</hi> in the Pronunciation, they place an <hi>o</hi> mute at the head, as they do at the head of the words, which begin with the Vowel: this is not regular, but they are all incapable of all theſe little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>No</hi> which is the laſt Letter of the third diviſion is not pronounced at the end of words like our <hi>n,</hi> but like the <hi>n</hi> of the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> I have writ it with an <hi>u</hi> ſimple, in writing the <hi>Siameſe</hi> words with our Characters; and ſometimes to avoid ill agreement, which theſe words cauſed with thoſe of our Language, I have thereunto added an <hi>e</hi> feminine, although this be ill, in that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> pronounce it not, ſeeing that they unlooſe not not the Tongue from the roof of the Mouth, in pronouncing their <hi>n</hi> at the end of words.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vo</hi> is pronounced indifferently like our <hi>v</hi> Conſonant, or like the <hi>w</hi> of the <hi>High-Germans,</hi> which is a <hi>b</hi> pronounced ſoftly, or without cloſing the Lips, or in fine like the <hi>w</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that is to ſay like our <hi>ou</hi> in the word <hi>oui.</hi> The <hi>Vo</hi> is likewiſe put after Vowels to form certain Dipthongs, in which caſe it is pronounced like our <hi>ou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The three <hi>So</hi> of the laſt diviſion, have the accent ſomewhat more ſharp one than the other, the Voice aſcending gradually to the laſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ho</hi> is put ſometimes before the Conſonants, to mollifie the pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>o</hi> is a mute Conſonant, as I have ſaid, which ſerves to place the Vowels, as the <hi>Aleph</hi> ſerves to place the Points of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when the Syllable begins with a Vowel, or when it is only a Vowel: but the <hi>o</hi> becomes a Vowel, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced like our <hi>o</hi> when it is preceded by another Conſonant, or by itſelf.</p>

                        <hi>Ai</hi> is a Dipthong and not a ſingle Vowel, and is pronounced as in our excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of complaint, <hi>ai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aou</hi> is alſo a Dipthong, which muſt be pronounced as <hi>au</hi> in <hi>Italian</hi> and in <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> but the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Orthography is altogether fantaſtical: for it anſwers to <hi>ea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Am</hi> is a Syllable and not a Vowel. The <hi>a</hi> is there clearly marked after the <hi>Ko,</hi> and that little <hi>o</hi> which is at top, denotes the <hi>m</hi> final. They have put the <hi>m</hi> final amongſt the Vowels, becauſe they have marked it above the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, after the manner of the Vowels. They do ſometimes alſo place at the end of the Syllables and Words, the <hi>m</hi> which is in their Alphabet of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants.</p>
                     <p>The laſt <hi>a</hi> which is marked with two points is an <hi>a</hi> very ſhort, which ſuffers no other Letter after it in the ſame Syllable, and which is pronounced only at the end of words: for in the middle it is frequently loſt, and becomes our <hi>e</hi> mute, ſuch as the firſt <hi>e</hi> of <hi>purete:</hi> wherefore in ſeveral <hi>Siameſe</hi> words I have omitted this <hi>a,</hi> and ſometimes I have written it with an <hi>e.</hi> Thus I have put <hi>Jocbat</hi> for <hi>Joccabat, Blat</hi> or <hi>Belat</hi> for <hi>Balat,</hi> by reaſon that this Orthography more nearly approaches their Pronunciation.</p>
                     <p>The Character of the firſt <hi>a</hi> is always joyned to the Conſonant, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placed after it, 'tis an <hi>a</hi> long, which is as two, as we anciently write aage for age.</p>
                     <p>The four following Vowels are placed always over the Conſonant, and the long are marked with a ſtroke alſo. The two Vowels after, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſixth and the ſeventh are placed underneath, and the ſeventh is only the double ſtroke of the ſixth. The five following are placed before the Conſonant, and the <hi>e</hi> long is only the <hi>e</hi> ſhort redoubled.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>aou</hi> conſiſts in two Characters, which anſwers <hi>ea</hi> as I have ſaid, and the <hi>e</hi> is always put before the Conſonant, and the <hi>a</hi> after, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>m</hi> final marked with a little <hi>o</hi> is placed always on the Conſonant, and is pronounced without opening the Lips.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>a</hi> ſhort and ſharp, marked with two points, is always put after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant, and ſuffers no Letter after it in the ſame Syllable.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Vowels thus diſpoſed, ſometimes above, ſometimes below, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before, ſometimes after the Conſonant, are always pronounced after it, as I have already declared. This would be a trouble to us, when the Syllable begins with a Mute and a Liquid, like <hi>pret,</hi> the Letters of which they would range thus <hi>eprt,</hi> ſo that we could not know if it were neceſſary to ſay <hi>pret</hi> or <hi>pert:</hi> but they always pronounce the Liquid before the Vowel, ſaying <hi>pret,</hi> and not <hi>pert.</hi> They cannot pronounce <hi>pert</hi> but <hi>pent:</hi> they will alſo ſay <hi>pent</hi> for <hi>pelt,</hi> and they will range the Letters in this manner, <hi>lept,</hi> or <hi>rept,</hi> or <hi>nept,</hi> The <hi>e</hi> pronouncing itſelf always after the Conſonant, which follows it in the writing, leaves not any doubt to them in this Orthography. For <hi>pnet,</hi> or <hi>pent, pmet</hi> or <hi>pemt,</hi> they will always pronounce <hi>pent</hi> and <hi>pemt.</hi>

Whence it appears, that deſigning to place certain Vowels before the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they have choſen thoſe, which in the pronunciation of the Dipthongs

                     <head>Of a fourth <hi>Siameſe</hi> Alphabet, which I have not graved.</head>
                     <p>THis Alphabet is of the Syllables which begin, and which end with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants, and it teaches two things. Firſt, there are two Vowels, an <hi>a</hi> and an <hi>o,</hi> which muſt never begin the Syllable nor end it, but be always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Conſonants. They have a particular Accent. The <hi>a</hi> is marked with a ſharp accent ′, oftentimes very much lengthned, and always placed over the firſt Conſonant of the Syllable; and the <hi>o</hi> is marked with a double Accent ſharp ″, which they put likewiſe over the firſt Conſonant of the Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When in the pronunciation the Syllable ends not with a Conſonant, they put the <hi>o</hi> mute in the place of the ſecond Conſonant, as may be ſeen in the Syllable <hi>Ko</hi> in the Alphabet of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Dipthongs: yet they ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe therewith after the accent ′, which marks the <hi>a,</hi> but never after the two accents ″, which mark the <hi>o.</hi> Sometimes alſo inſtead of the double accent, which marks the <hi>o,</hi> they put a little <hi>o</hi> over the firſt Conſonant, and ſometimes they put nothing; and as often as two Conſonants make a Syllable, it is the <hi>o</hi> that muſt be underſtood. The ſecond thing which this Alphabet teaches, are the final Conſonants, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt <hi>ko,</hi> the <hi>ngo,</hi> the <hi>do,</hi> the <hi>no,</hi> the <hi>mo,</hi> and the <hi>bo.</hi> As often as they end a Syllable, with any other Conſonant, it is a fault againſt their Orthography. They pronounce theſe only at the end of the Syllables, and they never ſhow their Children any Syllable to read, which ends with any other Conſonant, than with thoſe I have mentioned. It is true that they pronounce the <hi>do</hi> like a <hi>to,</hi> and the <hi>bo</hi> like a <hi>po</hi> at the end of ſome Syllables and Words.</p>

                     <p>The Pluperfect is compoſed of the Particles of the Imperfect, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                        <hi>Hai</hi> denotes the Imperative, and is put before the Verb. <hi>Teut</hi> alſo denotes it, and is placed always at the end of the Phraſe: <hi>haikin</hi> eat, or rather <hi>kin teut,</hi> or rather <hi>hai kin teut.

                        <hi>Reu</hi> is the Note of Interrogation. <hi>Kin le ou reu?</hi> Hath he eaten? or have you eaten? <hi>Leou,</hi> as we have ſaid, is the ſign of the Perfect, <hi>reu</hi> is plac'd always at the end of the Phraſe.</p>
                     <p>To ſay <hi>I did eat,</hi> they ſay I would eat, <hi>tcha erai ken. Tcha</hi> is the ſign of the future, <hi>crai</hi> ſignifies to will, and ſo <hi>tcha crai</hi> ſignifies <hi>I would,</hi> and <hi>kin</hi> ſignifies to eat.</p>
                     <p>To ſay <hi>if I was at</hi> Siam, <hi>I ſhould be ſatisfied,</hi> they would ſay word for word, <hi>if me to be City</hi> Siam, <hi>my heart good much. Heart good</hi> ſignifies <hi>content,</hi> and the Verb <hi>I ſhould be</hi> is there underſtood.</p>

                     <head>A Smoaking Inſtrument made uſe of by the <hi>Moors,</hi> which are at <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THey have a glaſs bottle of the figure of our Caraffas, excepting that it has a foot to be more firm, they fill it up half with water, and into the neck, which is all of a bigneſs and very long, they put a ſilver Pipe wound about with a Fillet, to the end that it cloſe the better: but this Pipe enters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the length of two Fingers breadth, though it be more than half a Foot long. At the upper end is a little Cup, either of Silver or Porcelane, which has the bottom perforated to communicate with the Pipe; and in this Cup is the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, on which they put a live coal. From the ſide of the Pipe there proceeds another much leſs in form of a Spout, or rather it is the little one which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the great one at the ſide, and it deſcends within the great one, and as far as the great one it ſelf, yet without filling the whole capacity thereof, but leaving a ſpace through which the ſmoak of the Tobacco, which is conſumed in the Porcelane Cup, may deſcend into the Bottle. In fine, to the inferior Orifice of the little Pipe, they put another little Pipe of Bambou, bound about alſo with a little Ribbon or black Silk, which deſcends into the water. Now he that would ſmoak, ſetting this glaſs bottle, or rather all this Machine which I have deſcribed upon the ground, puts into the ſuperior orifice of the little ſilver pipe, the end of a Bambou-ſlip, which though of one ſingle ſhoot is ſometimes between ſeven and eight foot long. The two ends thereof are gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Gold or Silver, and beſides this one of the two is garniſhed with a little Chryſtal Pipe, which he that ſmoaks puts between his Lips. From this manner it ſeems that in ſmoaking, he would attract to his Mouth the Water of the Bottle, by reaſon of the Communication that there is from the Mouth of the Smoaker to the Water of the Bottle, <hi>viz.</hi> through the great Bambou ſlip, thro the little Silver Pipe to which it joyns, and thro the little Bambou Pipe which enters into the Water, and which unites at the lower end of the ſmall ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pipe: but inſtead of this, the exterior air not being able to enter into the Bottle, the Smoak of the Tobacco deſcends along the great ſilver Tube, not only into the Bottle, but even into the Water, to inſinuate it ſelf into the little tube of Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bou, from whence it aſcends to the Mouth of the Smoaker. So that he who inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Inſtrument, has very ingeniouſly apprehended that it would be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural that the Smoak ſhould be drawn into the water, and from the water to the Mouth of the Smoaker, then that the water, which is heavier than the ſmoak, ſhould yield to the force of this Attraction.</p>

                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:98501:103"/>Sometimes there are ſeveral ſmall Tubes round the great one, to the end that ſeveral perſons may ſmoak in company with the ſame Inſtrument, and the better to ſettle it, it is placed on a copper Baſon, covered in that place with a little piece of cloth, which hinders the foot of the Bottle from ſlipping over the Baſon.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THeir Cheſs-board is compoſed like ours of 64 ſquares,<note place="margin">A Deſcription of their Cheſs-board, and the number of their Men.</note> but which are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by white and black. Neither do they place their pieces in the Squares, but at the corners of the Squares, that is to ſay at the points where the lines of the Cheſs-board do interſect. Moreover the Cheſs-board is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two halves, thirty two Squares for each of the two Players, and theſe two halves are ſeparated by a ſpace, which they call the River. It is about the bigneſs of a row of Squares, and runs not from one Player to the other: but after the ſame manner wherewith the pieces are ranged on the Cheſs-board. 'Tis not therefore the Squares which are the Points of their game, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Squares. And ſo they have nine Points on each line, and there are five times nine or forty five on each half of the Cheſs-board; I have marked them with circles.</p>
                     <p>They have thirty two Men like us, ſixteen for each Gameſter, the one white, the other black; but theſe Men are not all the ſame as ours, and they diſpoſe them not altogether after the ſame manner. Every Gameſter has a King and no Queen, two Guards, two Elephants, two Horſemen, two Waggons, two Cannons, and five Pawns. Each Gameſter places nine Men on the firſt Line of the Cheſs-board, which is on his ſide, at the Points where this firſt Line is divided, and on thoſe where it is terminated. Theſe nine Men are, the King, whom they place in the middle; the two Guards which are next him, the one on the right and the other on the left; the two Elephants which are next the Guards, the one on the right and the other on the left; then the two Horſemen, the one on the right and the other on the left; and in fine the two Waggons which take up the two corners of the Cheſs-board. The two Cannons are placed in the ſecond Point before the two Horſemen, and the Pawns in the firſt, third, fifth, ſeventh, and ninth Points of the fourth Line, that is to ſay on that which is our Cheſs-board, ſeparates the firſt Points before the Men, from the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>The King makes only one ſtep as in our Game,<note place="margin">The motion of their Men.</note> but he cannot do it every way: he goes forward, or backward, or ſide ways, as do our Rooks, but he marches not bias-wiſe like our Biſhops. Moreover he cannot ſtir out of a Square, which is his field of Battle or his Palace, and which contains four Squares, which on our Cheſs-board are thoſe, where we place the King and Queen, and the Pawns of the King and Queen.</p>
                     <p>The two Guards do not move alſo out of the Square, and they never make more than one ſtep, but bias-wiſe like our Biſhops, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The two Elephants do move after the manner of our Biſhops, but they do always make two ſteps, and never more nor leſs, and they paſs not the River: they enter not into the Enemy's Camp. I underſtood that the Elephant is called <hi>fil</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and that it is from this word <hi>fil</hi> that we have taken that of <hi>fol</hi> or Biſhop for that of our Cheſs-men which anſwers to the Elephant.</p>
                     <p>The Horſeman skips two points like our Knight, the one of which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the march of our Rooks, and the other is according to the walk of our Biſhop. But their Horſeman leaps not over the other Men: it is neceſſary that he have the way open, at leaſt on one ſide. I explain my ſelf. The walk of the Horſeman is compoſed of two ſteps, as I have ſaid, the one of which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the march of our Rook, and the other according to that of our Biſhop. It is therefore neceſſary that the firſt ſtep of the Horſeman, be free
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98501:104"/>
in one ſenſe, that is to ſay, either according to the march of the Rook, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Biſhop. Beſides the Horſeman may paſs the River, and the breadth of the River is eſteem'd one of the two ſteps that he muſt take, as if it was a Rank of Squares.</p>
                     <p>The Waggons march like our Rooks, and may paſs the River. The Cannons have alſo the walk of our Rooks, and may paſs the River.</p>
                     <p>The Pawns do only make one ſtep as amongſt us, and they never have the liberty of making two, not even the firſt time that they are uſed. They may paſs the River which is always reckoned for one ſtep, and when they have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, they may move not only forwards, but alſo ſideways like the Rook, and never bias-ways like the Biſhop, and like our Pawns when they take, nor alſo backward, not even when they have been at the end of the Game, which we call making a Queen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The deſign of the Game.</note>The deſign of the Game is to give Check-mate, as amongſt us; and the King is obliged amongſt them, as amongſt us, to free himſelf from Check, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by removing place, or by covering himſelf from Check.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How their men do take.</note>Every Man takes, by putting it ſelf in the place of the Man which it takes, provided that the walk from the one to the other be free. There is only the Cannon which requires that there be a Man between it, and that which it takes, and it matters not whether this Man be Friend or Enemy. 'Tis ſaid that it ſerves as a carriage. Thus it is neceſſary that there be a Man between the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and the King, for that the Cannon gives Check to the King; and if the Man which is between both, is on the King's ſide, he whoſe King is in Check, may free him from Check by taking away this Man, and by expoſing the King before the Cannon. In a word one Cannon may ſerve as a carriage to another Cannon.</p>
                     <p>Their Pawns take not bias-ways like ours, but in the natural ſenſe of their walk, which is forward, when they have not paſſed the River: and forward or ſideways according to the march of our Rook, when they have paſſed the River.</p>
                     <p>One cannot put nor leave his King oppoſite to the other King, when there is not a Man between both, he that ſhould do it, or would take the Man that is between both, would himſelf put his own King in Check, which cannot be done, yet the King can take nothing but what is at a point near him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the march of our Rook, and not according to the march of our Biſhop.</p>

The Inſtrument may be more ſimple if one will, by putting only four Beads on one ſide, and one on the other, becauſe that this is ſufficient to mark to nine on each ſtick, which is all that is requir'd; and in this ſimplicity was the <hi>Roman</hi> Inſtrument, which in my Relation I have mentioned, that <hi>Pignorius</hi> has given us. From whence the Learned may, at their pleaſure, draw their Conjectures, to decide which of theſe two Inſtruments is probably the Original, either the moſt compound, or the moſt ſimple.

                     </head>
                     <p>I Have given three different Proſpects thereof, two of which are entirely new, and the third, which is that whoſe place of view is in the Road, is copied after a very good <hi>Dutch</hi> Map.</p>
                     <p>Every one knows that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have an important Eſtabliſhment there, which ſecures their Navigation from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> The Fort which defends it, would perhaps be no conſiderable thing in <hi>Europe;</hi> but it is ſufficient in a Country, where there is no Neighbour to fear, and where there can go no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Enemy, but from a great diſtance, and conſequently with a great deal of difficulty.</p>
                     <p>The Company's Garden, the Platform whereof is in one of theſe Prints, is very ſpacious, as may be judged by comparing it to the Fort: And tho' the Soil be not over-good, it plentifully produces Coleworts, Citruls, Oranges, Pomegranets, and, in a word, Pulſe and Fruits, which keep at Sea, and of which the Mariners are deſirous in long Voyages. In a corner, and under a ſhelter, I ſaw a Camphire-Tree, an <hi>European</hi> Fig-Tree, and a Shrub about two Foot high, which was ſaid to be that which bears the Tea, and which I had taken for a young Pear-Tree. It had neither Flowers nor Fruit, and very few Leaves. Cloſe by, and under another ſhelter, were two or three Foot of <hi>Ananas,</hi> and this was all the Rarity they ſhow'd me for the Country. The Grape is not more rare, but there is only that which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have planted there. The Wine thereof is white, and very good. Some of our Crew went to the top of the Table Mountain, to ſeek ſome extraordinary Plants, but they found none. Nevertheleſs, upon a ſtrict Scrutiny, there is not any that has not ſomething particular, which the Plants of theſe Countries have not. The ſhells there found are not the Remains of the Deluge, as ſome have conjectur'd. The Birds, the Apes, and the <hi>Hotantots,</hi> do bring them, and leave them there.</p>
                     <p>The Walks of the Garden do almoſt ſpontaneouſly maintain themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Soil produces only Moſs if it is not cultivated: Beſides the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Garden has nothing, which ſavours not a wiſe oeconomy, nor any thing which ſavours a too great negligence, like a Kitchen Garden of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, more wedded to the profit, which they reap thence, than to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which they could not enjoy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:98501:106"/>The water which waters it through ſeveral little Channels, enters therein at the going out from a Mill which it turns, and underneath the Garden, it ſerves for blanching. They only divert a part thereof, which is conducted to a Ciſtern, which is on the bank of the Road, and where the Ships do go to take in their freſh water.</p>
                     <p>The Garden is divided into ſeveral great Squares, almoſt like the Plot of the place Royal. They are encompaſſed with Pales, to ſhelter them from the Winds, which are ſometimes furious enough to wreck the Ships in the Road, if they have not good Anchors and good Cables. Theſe Winds are formed of the thick Clouds, which do ſometimes aſſemble between the Table-Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that which is called the Mountain of the Wind, by reaſon of theſe Storms. A walk of Citron-trees and Orange-trees planted in Earth, which go from one end of the Garden to the other, do altogether reſent their fury. Next to this the ſituation of the Garden, and that of the Village which is a little nearer to the Road, are very good; for they are wholly expoſed to the Sun, and ſheltered from the South Winds, which are the cold Winds of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> which are ſetled there, do ſay, that if the South-weſt Wind blows not during their Summer, which is our Winter, the Diſtempers of the Lungs are frequent and dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The ſhort ſtay that I made, permitted me not througly to inſtruct my ſelf concerning the Manners of the <hi>Hotantots,</hi> the natural Inhabitants of the Cape, though in the extream Simplicity in which they live, this can be no long ſtudy. They are called <hi>Hotantots,</hi> becauſe that when they dance, they always in ſinging ſay this word <hi>Hotantot.</hi> The Love of the Tobacco and Brandy, which the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers offer them, and which has made them to receive the <hi>Hollanders</hi> into their Country, makes them to dance ſo long as one will, that is to ſay, to ſtamp ſometimes with one Foot, and ſometimes with the other, as he that treads the Grapes, and inceſſantly, and vigorouſly to ſay, <hi>Hotantot, Hotantot,</hi> but with a very low voice, as if they were out of breath, or that they fear'd to awaken any one. This mute Song has no diverſity of Tones, but of Meaſure: the two firſt Syllables of <hi>Hotantot</hi> are always two Blacks, or Crochets, and the laſt always a White or Minime.</p>
                     <p>They go all naked, as may be ſeen in the figure, which I have given. They have but one skin over their Shoulders, like a Cloak; yet do they quit it at every place: and then they have only a little Leather Purſe, hung to their Neck by a ſtring, and a piece of a Skin a little bigger than one's Hand, hung before, and faſtned with another ſtring round their body: but this little piece covers them not, either when they ſhow themſelves ſide-ways, or when they do make a brisk motion.</p>
                     <p>Their ſtature is acceptable, and their gate more eaſy, than can be expreſſed. They are born as white as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but they have their Hair very much frizled, and Features participating ſomewhat of thoſe of the <hi>Negro's:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they are always very black; becauſe that they greaſe their Body and Face. They do alſo greaſe their Head, and we ſmell them twenty Paces, when they have the Wind. Our men gave them Pots, and Cauldrons to bath in; and before all things, they took the Fat by hands-full, and herewith anointed their whole Body, from the Head to the Feet. The Greaſe defends them from the Air and the Sun, renders them ſound and well diſpoſed, and they prefer theſe natural Advantages before Sweet Scents and Pleaſure. They are ſo active, that ſeveral among them do out-run Horſes. There is no Brook which they ſwim not over. They are expert in drawing the Bow, and throwing the Dart; and they have Courage even to Undauntedneſs. They do ſometimes worſt a Lion, provided they have Skins enough, and Furniture enough to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their left Arm. They do thruſt it thus into the Throat of this Animal, and they pierce it with a Dart or Knife, which they will have in their right hand. If they are two, the one kills the Lion, whilſt the other amuſes him. If they are ſeveral, and they have nothing to ſecure themſelves from the Claws of the Lion, they fail not to expoſe themſelves all at once: The one of them generally periſhes, but the Lion periſhes likewiſe by the Blows which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98501:106"/>
the others give him. Sometimes they are all ſaved, and they kill the Lion.</p>
                     <p>Their Wives do likewiſe greaſe themſelves, though they affect ſome Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as to faſten little Bones and Shells to their ſhort Cottony, and greaſie Hair. They alſo have Necklaces with divers colors of Glaſs, Bone, or ſuch other matter, according as the Foreigners do give them, or ſell them to them. On each Leg they have fifty Rings of Leather, which do beat one upon the other, and make ſome Noiſe when they dance, and which defend them from the Briers, when they go to get Wood: for this care concerns them, and not their Husbands.</p>
                     <p>The Men and the Women did eat Guts, almoſt without cleanſing them, when our men preſented them therewith, and they did hardly put them a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Coals. If we offer'd them Brandy, they would gather up the firſt Shell, they found on the ground to receive it, and after having blow'd therein, they uſed to drink in it. They eat their Lice, as well as the <hi>Cochinchineſe:</hi> and when we thought it ſtrange, they anſwer'd pleaſantly, that 'tis becauſe their Lice eat them.</p>
                     <p>They lodge under little Huts made of Branches, or great Bulruſh Mats, the top of which hardly reach'd to my middle; and to me it ſeem'd that I could not lye therein, my whole length. Under theſe Mats they make a hole in the ground, and in this Hole, about two Foot deep, they make their Fire, not caring for the Smoak, whereof their Huts do not empty themſelves. They live on Hunting, Fiſhing, Milk and the Fleſh of their Flocks.</p>
                     <p>In this Poverty they are always merry, ſinging and dancing continually, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Pains and Buſineſs: and caring for Gold and Silver, only as far as it is neceſſary for them to buy a little Tobacco and Brandy; a Corruption which the Foreign Commerce has introduced into their Cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>As ſome amongſt them were exerciſing themſelves, in throwing the Dart before us, I offer'd them five or ſix Papers of Necklaces with Beads of colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Glaſs; and they all ſo exactly ſeized my Hand, that I could not open it to let go the Necklaces, and I could not beſides explain my ſelf unto them. I was ſometime in this perplexity, till they perceived that they muſt ſet me at Liberty to obtain what they deſired. They love theſe Necklaces for their Wives, and when we had ſet ſail again, I underſtood that a Laquais of ours had ſold one for a Crown to one of them. The little Money they have, and of which they have little eſteem, is the Wages for the Service which they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſometimes to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to the other Foreigners, which land at the <hi>Cape:</hi> but they care but little to work.</p>
                     <p>Every one has but one Wife, their Chief only has three, and Adultery amongſt them is puniſhed with Death. They kill their Children, when they have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and as they marry thoſe which they keep, exceeding young, there is ſeen amongſt them a great many Grand-Daughters, already Widows; who want a Joynt in their little Finger: For when a Woman loſes her Husband, ſhe cuts off a Joynt of the little Finger, or of the fourth Finger, if ſhe has ſo often been a Widow, as to have her whole little Finger cut off. Nevertheleſs ſhe may diſpence therewith, if ſhe pleaſe: and there are ſome Husbands who diſpence not therewith, when they have loſt their Wife. Moſt of them do make themſelves Ridgils, to be more fit for the Women; and when the Age of renouncing comes, they make themſelves entirely Eunuchs, to deprive themſelves wholly of their Commerce, and to enjoy a more vigorous old Age. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> had edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated an <hi>Hotantot</hi> Infant after the <hi>European</hi> manner, and had ſent him into <hi>Holland.</hi> Sometime after they cauſed him to return to the Cape, where he might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them amongſt thoſe of his own Nation. But ſo ſoon as he found himſelf again amongſt them, he continued there, and renounced the <hi>Dutch</hi> Habit, and Manner of living.</p>
                     <p>They commit no Robbery amongſt themſelves, nor in the Houſes of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> where they are received without Care: and if the thing happens, they puniſh it with Death. Nevertheleſs in the Country, when they can do it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and that they think not to be diſcovered, they do ſometimes aſſaſſinate to rob; and do ſhow that the Contempt of Riches is, amongſt them, only the Hatred of work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:98501:107"/>The <hi>Dutch</hi> do nominate their Chief, and this Chief is their Judge: but thoſe who could not bear this Foreign Dependance, are gone further into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to live with the other <hi>Caffres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some informed me at firſt, that they had no ſence of Religion; but at laſt I underſtood, that tho they have neither Prieſts nor Temples, yet they make public rejoycing, which ſavor of Worſhip, at the New and Full Moons. I ſuſpect that they have ſome Tincture of <hi>Manicheiſme,</hi> becauſe that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Principle of Good, and another of Evil, which they call the <hi>Captain above,</hi> and the <hi>Captain below.</hi> The <hi>Captain above,</hi> they ſay, is good, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to pray to him, 'tis only needful to let him act freely, he always does good: But the <hi>Captain below</hi> is wicked, he muſt be prayed to, and intreated to divert him from miſchief. 'Tis thus that they ſpeak, but it appears not in their exterior Conduct, that they pray much. A <hi>Dutchman</hi> of Wit and Knowledge informed me, that amongſt the <hi>Hotantots,</hi> he had found the Names of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and of <hi>Bocchus.</hi>

                     <head>Rules of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Aſtronomy, for calculating the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sun and Moon, tranſlated from the <hi>Siameſe,</hi> and ſince examined and explained by <hi>M. Caſſini,</hi> a Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MOnſieur de la Loubere,</hi> the King's Ambaſſador extraordinary at <hi>Siam</hi> brought back a <hi>Siameſe</hi> Manuſcript, which comprehends the Rules for calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the motions of the Sun and Moon, according to the method of that Country, the Tranſlation thereof he likewiſe brought from <hi>Siam,</hi> and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto me.</p>
                     <p>This method is extraordinary. They make no uſe of Tables; but only of the Addition, Subſtraction, Multiplication, and Diviſion of certain numbers, of which we do not preſently diſcern the Ground, nor to what theſe numbers refer.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe numbers are conceal'd divers Periods of Solar Years, of Lunar Months, and other Revolutions, and the Relation of the one with the other. Under theſe numbers are likewiſe conceal'd ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Epoches</hi> which are not diſtinguiſhed, as the Civil Epoche, the Epoche of the Lunar Months, that of the Equinoxes, Apogaea, and Solar Cycle. The numbers in which the difference between theſe Epoches conſiſts, are not ordinarily at the head of the Operations to which they ſerve, as they ought to be according to the Natural Order: they are often mixed with certain numbers, and the Sums or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are multiplied or divided by others, for they are not always ſimple numbers, but frequently they are Fractions, ſometimes Simple, ſometimes Compound, without being ranged after the manner of Fractions, the Numerator being ſometimes in one Article, and the Denominator in another; as if they had had a contrived deſign to conceal the Nature and Uſe of theſe numbers. In the Calculation of the Sun, they intermix ſome things which appertain only to the Moon, and others which are not neceſſary, either to the one or to the other, without making any diſtinction. They confound together the Solar and the Luniſolar Years, the Months of the Moon, and the Months of the Sun, the Civil and the Aſtronomical Months, the Days Natural and the Days Artificial. The Zodiack is divided ſometimes into twelve Signs, according to the number of the Month of the Year, ſometimes into 27 parts, according to the number of the Days that the Moon runs through the Zodiack, and ſometimes in 30 parts, according to the number of the Days, that the Moon returns to the Sun. In the Diviſion of the Day there is no diſcourſe of Hours; but therein is found the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the 703<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and the 800<hi rend="sup">th</hi> parts of the Day, which reſult from the Arithmetical Operations which are preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>This Method is ingenious; and being illuſtrated, rectified, and purged from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98501:107"/>
Superfluities, it will be of ſome uſe, being practicable without books, by the means of divers Cycles, and of the difference of their Epoches. Wherefore it is that I have endeavoured to decypher it, what difficulty ſoever I found at firſt, not only by reaſon of the confuſion which every where appeared, and of the Names which are wanting in the ſuppoſed numbers; but likewiſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the extraordinary names, which are given to what reſults from the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of which there are more than Twenty which have not been interpreted by the Tranſlator, and of which I could never have found the Signification, if I had not firſt diſcover'd the method; which has likewiſe evinced to me, that the Interpretation, which the Tranſlator has made of three or four other names, is not very exact.</p>
                     <p>In this reſearch I have firſt diſtinguiſhed, and ſeparated from the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, thoſe which belong to the Epoches, having obſerved that theſe numbers, are thoſe which were given to add or to ſubſtract, either ſimply, or by dividing or multiplying them by certain other numbers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I have conſidered the Analogies which reſult from the Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diviſions of the other numbers, ſeparated from the Epoches; and it is in the Terms of theſe Analogies, that I have found the Periods of the Years, of the Months, and of the Days, and the differences of the one from the other, which the experience of things Aſtronomical, and the occaſion of divers opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I have made, has given me to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>I thought that the Miſſionaries, to whom Aſtronomy gives admittance amongſt the great and learned throughout the Eaſt, might reap ſome advantage from this work, for the Underſtanding, and for the Explication of the Oriental Aſtronomy, which might eaſily be rectified and adapted to ours, with a little altering the Method, by correcting the numbers which it uſes.</p>
                     <p>I thought alſo that it would not be uſeleſs to reduce the Aſtronomy of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to this form, to be able to ſupply the want of the Tables which greatly abridge the work. This method would be much more eaſie to practiſe in the form of the <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Gregorian</hi> year of which we make uſe, than in the form of the Luniſolar year, which the Orientals obſerve: for their principal difficulty conſiſts in reducing the Luniſolar years and the Civil Lunary months to the years and months of the Sun, which the form of our Kalender immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gives us; and what has given me the moſt trouble, has been to find out the method which they uſe to reduce them, in which the ſeveral ſorts of Years, Months and Days, which are ſuppoſed and ſought, are not diſtinguiſhed. Wherefore the reaſon of the Explication which I give, and of the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Genus to the Species which I make in the beginning, will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be underſtood; but in the ſequel it will be comprehended by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things, and by what neceſſarily reſults therefrom.</p>

                     <head>Concerning the Aſtronomical Epocha of this Method.</head>
                     <p>I Have endeavoured to diſcover what is the <hi>Epocha,</hi> from whence they here begin to compute the Motions of the Sun and Moon; and to what year, what month, and what day of our Kalender it refers: for it is not treated of in this extract, which ſuppoſes it either known, or explained perhaps in the preceding Chapters from whence this extract has been taken, ſeeing that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the <hi>Epocha,</hi> it is abſolutely impoſſible to practice this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                     <p>I have found that this <hi>Epocha</hi> is Aſtronomical, and that it is different from the Civil, which I have underſtood, becauſe it is here preſcribed to begin to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Months of the Year, current with the fifth Month in the Leap Year, which conſiſts of 13 Months, and with the ſixth Month in the common Year, which conſiſts of 12 Months. For this would not be intelligible, if they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not two different <hi>Epoches</hi> of Years, the one whereof, which muſt be the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98501:108"/>
Aſtronomical, begins ſometimes in the fifth, and ſometimes in the ſixth Month of the other, which is the Civil. That which likewiſe evinc'd to me that the Aſtronomical <hi>Epoche,</hi> is different from the Civil <hi>Epocha,</hi> not only in the Months, but alſo in the Years, is the Operation which is here made to find the Year of ones Nativity, by ſubſtracting his Age from the number of the Years elaps'd ſince the <hi>Epocha;</hi> for this Operation would be uſeleſs, if they demand only the Year of the Birth after the Civil <hi>Epocha,</hi> which is immediately known, and which is compared to the Year current, to know the Age of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, I have firſt ſearched out the Age to which this Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical <hi>Epocha</hi> may refer; and having found in the Calculation of the Sun, performed by this method, that two Signs and twenty Degrees which are therein employed, can only denote the place of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> where was found the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Sun in the <hi>Epocha,</hi> which <hi>Apogaeum</hi> muſt be in the twentieth Degree of <hi>Gemini;</hi> I judged that this <hi>Epocha</hi> muſt be about the ſeventh Age, where the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Sun is found in the twentieth Degree of <hi>Gemini</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to moſt Aſtronomical Tables.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, having found that the number 621, which is intermixed in the Calculation of the Sun, can only be the number of the days comprized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> and the return of the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> to the beginning of the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> and that the number 3232, which is afterwards employed therein, can be only the number of the Days, during which, this <hi>Apogaeum</hi> makes a Revolution; I have confirmed that the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Moon, which in 621 Days makes two Signs and nine Degrees, was in this <hi>Epocha,</hi> in the 21 Degrees of <hi>Capricorn:</hi> And becauſe that the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution it makes in eight Years three quarters, returns to the ſame degree of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> twelve times in one Age; I have diſtinguiſhed the Years of the Age, in which the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> is found in this Degree, and I have excluded the other Year.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, having found by the method here uſed for Calculating the place of the Sun, that this Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> is very near the vernal Aequinox, which in the ſeventh Age fell on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> Amongſt theſe ſelect Years I have found one in which the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> arrived at this Degree of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> about the 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> which is found but once in 62 Years, wanting ſome Degrees; and I have found that in the 638<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Apogaeum</hi> of the Moon was at the 21ſt Degree of <hi>Capricorn</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>March.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I have remarked that this Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> muſt have begun at a new Moon; becauſe the Lunar Months are reduced into Days, to find the number of the Days from the <hi>Epocha,</hi> and the value of the whole Months being deducted from the Sum of the Days, the reſt ſerves to find the Moon's diſtance from the Sun.</p>
                     <p>In the 638<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of Jeſus Chriſt, the Aequinoxial new Moon happened the 21ſt of <hi>March</hi> at three a Clock in the Morning at <hi>Siam,</hi> when the Sun by its middle Motion ran through the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and the Moon's in the 21ſt Degree of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</hi> This Day was likewiſe remarkable for a great Eclipſe of the Sun, which happened the ſame day, but 14. Hours after the mean Conjunction.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, By the manner of finding the day of the week, which is here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it appears that the day of the <hi>Epocha,</hi> was a <hi>Saturday;</hi> and the 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year 638 was alſo a <hi>Saturday.</hi> This likewiſe confirms the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this Epocha, and demonſtrates the Knowledge and Judgment of thoſe that have eſtabliſhed it, who contented not themſelves with a Civil Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, as other Aſtronomers have done: but who have choſen an Aſtronomical one, which was the Natural Principle of ſeveral Revolutions, which could not begin again, till after ſeveral Ages. This <hi>Epocha</hi> is 5 Years and 278 Days diſtant from the <hi>Perſian Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſdegerdes,</hi> the firſt year of which began on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year of Jeſus Chriſt, 632. Yet theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules are not taken from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tables related by <hi>Criſococa;</hi> for theſe Tables do make
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98501:108"/>
the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> two degrees more backward, and the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> above ſix degrees forwarder; which agrees not ſo exactly with our modern Tables. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Tables do alſo make the Sun's Aequation 12 Minutes leſs, and that of the Moon 4 Minutes greater; which agrees better with the Moderns.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules are not drawn neither from the Tables of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> where the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> is fixed to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree and a half of <hi>Gemini;</hi> nor from the other Tables ſince made, which have all this moveable <hi>Apogaeum.</hi> It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they have been invented by the <hi>Indians;</hi> or that perhaps they have been taken from the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Aſtronomy, as may be conjectured from this, that in this extract the Numbers are written from the top downwards, after the manner of the <hi>Chineſes:</hi> but it may be that this way of writing the numbers might be common to theſe two Nations.</p>
                     <p>Having found the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> of this method, and the Relation it has with the <hi>Julian</hi> years; we may rectifie the <hi>Epocha</hi>'s of the motions of the Sun and Moon by the modern Tables, by adding about a Minute a Year to the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and by correcting the other Periods. Thus there will be no difficulty, to reduce the Years and Months ſince the <hi>Epocha</hi> into days; and if the Equations are likewiſe corrected conformably to the modern Tables, we ſhall by the ſame Method, find the place of the Sun and Moon with a great deal more exactneſs. We will give this Correction, with the Supplement of what is wanting in theſe Rules, after that we have explained them.</p>

The form of the Year here mentioned, is luniſolar, ſeeing there are ſome common of 12 lunar months, and abundant or Emboliſmal, called <hi>Attikamaat,</hi> of 13 lunar months. For that they begin to compute the months, not with the firſt month of the year, but with the fifth, if it is Leap-year, and with the ſixth if it is not: I have inferred that there are two Epocha's, and two forms of different
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98501:109"/>
Years, the one Aſtronomical and the other Civil: that the firſt Month of the Aſtronomical Year begins in the fifth Month of the Civil Leap-year, which would be the ſixth Month without the intercalation of the Leap-month, which is not reckoned amongſt the 12 Months, and which is ſuppoſed to be inſerted before; and that in the other Years, all the Months of which are ſucceſſively computed without Intercalation, the firſt Month of the Aſtronomical Year, is computed only from the ſixth Month of the Civil Year.</p>
                        <p>But as it is not expreſly determined here, whether one ought to begin to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute an entire month at the beginning or end of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month, it may be that for the firſt month of the Aſtronomical Year they take, that which ends at the beginning of the months whereof it is diſcourſed in this Article. In this caſe, the Interval between the beginning of the Civil Year, and the beginning of the Aſtronomical Year, would be only of 3 or 4 entire months: whereas if an entire month is reckoned only at the end of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month, and that the firſt month which is reckoned, according to this Rule, be the firſt of the Aſtronomical Year; the interval between the beginnings of theſe two ſorts of years, will be 4 or 5 whole months. We ſhall ſee in ſequel, that the <hi>Indians</hi> have diverſe ſorts of Aſtronomical Years, the beginnings of which are different, and are not much diſtant from the Vernal Aequinox; whereas the Civil Year muſt begin before the Winter Solſtice, ſometimes in the month of <hi>November,</hi> ſometimes in the month of <hi>December</hi> of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Year.</p>
                        <p>They add the number of the months of the current year, which are lunar months, to thoſe that they have found by the third Article, which are ſolar months; and they ſuppoſe that the ſum, as heterogeneous as it is, ſhould be equal to the number of the ſolar months elapſed from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha.</hi> They neglect the difference that there may be, which in a year cannot amount to an entire month: but they might be deceived a month in the ſucceſſion of the years, if they took not good heed to the Intercalations of the months, after which the number of the months which are computed in the Civil Year, is leſſer than that which they would reckon without the precedent Intercalations.</p>

They here ſeek the number of the lunar months from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> diſcourſed of in the 1ſt. Article, to the beginning of the current month: which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reducing the ſolar months, which are ſuppoſed to have been found above, into lunar months, by the means of the difference, which is between the one and the other. In the operations which are made, is is ſuppoſed that as 228 is to 7, ſo the number of the ſolar months given, is to the difference which the number of the lunary months ſurpaſſes the number given of the ſolar months elapſed, during the ſame ſpace of time; that thus in 228 ſolar months, which do make 19 years, there are 228 lunary months, and 7 months more, that is to ſay 235 lunary months. This therefore is a Period like to that of <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Meto,</hi> and to our Cycle of the golden number of 19 years, during which the Moon rejoyn'd it ſelf 235 times to the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Yet in the ſequel we ſhall ſee, that theſe Periods which accord together in the number of the lunar months and ſolar years, agree not in the number of the hours, by reaſon of the greatneſs of the ſolar year and of the lunar month, which is ſuppoſed various in theſe ſeveral Periods: and that the <hi>Indian</hi> is not ſubject to a fault ſo great, as the ancient Cycle of the Golden Number, which they have been obliged to expunge out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kalender, in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> correction, becauſe it gave the new Moons later than they are, almoſt a day in 312 years; whereas the New Moons determined by this <hi>Indian</hi> Period, agree with the true in this interval of time to near an hour, as will be found by comparing theſe Rules with the following.</p>

Art. is to the number of the days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to have the number of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural days, which anſwers to this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the artificial days: whence it appears, that by making the lunar month to conſiſt of 30 artificial days, 703 of theſe days do ſurpaſs the number of the natural days, which equal them above eleven days.</p>
                        <p>One may find the greatneſs of the Lunar Month, which reſults from this <hi>Hyphotheſis:</hi> for if 703 Artificial Days do give an exceſs of 11 Days; 30 of theſe Days which do make a Lunar Month, do give an exceſs of 330/703 in the Day; and as 703 is to 330, ſo 24 Hours are to 11 Hours, 15 Minutes, 57 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds; and deducting this <hi>Overplus</hi> from 30 Days, there remains 29 Days, 12 Hours, 44 Minutes, 3 Seconds for the Lunar Month, which agrees within a Second to the Lunar Month determined by our Aſtronomers.</p>
                        <p>As to the value of 59 Days and 1/11 which is added before the Diviſion, it appears that if 703 Days do give 11 to ſubſtract, 59 Days and 1/11 do give 650/703 in the Day, which do make 22 Hours, 11 Minutes and a half, by which the end of the Artificial Day, muſt arrive before the end of the Natural Day, which is taken for the <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Anamaan</hi> is the number of the 703 parts of the Day, which remain from the end of the Artificial Day, to the end of the current Natural Day. Uſe is made hereof in the ſequel to calculate the motion of the Moon, as ſhall be afterwards explained.</p>
                        <p>The Quotient which is taken from the number of the Days found by the third Art. is the difference of the entire Days, which is found between the number of the Artificial Days, and the number of the Natural Days from the <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Horoconne</hi> is the number of the Natural Days elapſed from the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Epocha</hi> to the current Day. It ſhould ſeem that in rigour the Addition of the Days of the current Month, preſcribed by the third Article, ſhould not be made till after the Multiplication and Diviſion, which ſerves to find the difference of the Artificial Days from the Natural, becauſe that the Days of the Current Month are Natural, and not Artificial of 30 <hi>per menſem:</hi> but

                        <p>HAving explained the Rules compriſed in the preceding Sections, and found our ſeveral Periods of Years, Months, and Days, which they ſuppoſe: It remains to us particularly to explain divers particular <hi>Epocha's,</hi> which we have found in the numbers employed in this Method, which being compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ſerve to determine the Year, the Month, the Day, the Hour, and the Meridian of the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> which is not ſpoken of in the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules, which ſuppoſe it known.</p>
                        <p>By the Rules of the I. Section, is ſought the number of the Lunary Months elapſed from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha.</hi> The <hi>Epocha</hi> which they ſuppoſe in this Section is therefore that of the Lunar Months; and conſequently it muſt be at the Hour of the middle Conjunction from whence begins the Month wherein the <hi>Epocha</hi> is.</p>
                        <p>By the Rules of the II. Section, they firſt reduce the Lunar Months elapſed from the <hi>Epocha</hi> into Artificial Days of 30 <hi>per menſem,</hi> which are ſhorter than the Natural Days, from one Noon to the other, by 11/703 a Day, that is to ſay by 22 Minutes 32 Seconds of an Hour. Theſe Artificial Days have therefore their beginning at the new Moons, and at every thirtieth part of the Lunar Month; but the Natural Days do always begin naturally at Midnight under the ſame Meridian. The Term of the Artificial Days agrees not then with the Term of the Natural Days, in the ſame Hour and ſame Minute, unleſs when the Month, or one of the 30 parts of the Month, begins at Midnight under the Meridian given at the choice of the Aſtronomer. After this common beginning the end of the Artificial Day, prevents the end of the Natural Day under the ſame Meridian 11/703 a Day, in which does then conſiſt the <hi>Anamaan,</hi> which always augments one 703<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of a Day to every eleventh part of the Day, until that the number of the 703 parts, amounts to 703, or ſurpaſſes this number; for then they take 703 of theſe parts for a Day, whereby the number of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Days ſurpaſſes the number of the Natural Days, elaps'd ſince the <hi>Epocha;</hi> and the remainder, if there is any, is the <hi>Anamaan.</hi> The day of this meeting or concourſe of the term of the Artificial days with the term of the Natural Days under the Meridian which is choſen, is always a new <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maan,</hi>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:98501:114"/>
which is reduced to nothing, or to leſs than 11, after having attained this number 703; which arrives only at every Period of 64 Days, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in dividing 703 by 11, and more exactly eleven times in 703 Days. At every time given for the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Anamaan</hi> they then take the Day of the preceeding rencounter of the beginning of the Artificial Days with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Natural Days, which under the ſame Meridian happens only five or ſix times in a Year.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then that in the fifth Article of the II. Section, they add 650 ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths of a Day to thoſe which are elapſed from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the I. Section, they ſuppoſe that this <hi>Epocha</hi> was proceeded from another <hi>Epocha</hi> which could only be that of the <hi>Anamaan,</hi> of 650 elevenths of a Day; that is to ſay of 59 Days 1/11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, which do give 650/703 of a Day for the <hi>Anamaan,</hi> under the Meridian of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> to which the Rules of this II. Section are accommodated; which ſhows that under this Meridian the middle Conjunction which gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the Artificial Day ſince the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> was 650/703 of a Day before the end of the Natural Day in which this conjunction happen'd; And conſequently that it happen'd at one a Clock 49 Minutes in the morning, under the Meridian which is ſuppoſed in the ſame Section: but in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section, they deduct 40 Minutes from the motion of the Moon; and in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section, they deduct 3 minutes from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun: which removes the Moon 37 minutes from the Sun, at the hour that they ſuppoſe the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, in the II. Section.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I have judged that the 40 minutes taken from the motion of the Moon, and the 3 minutes taken from the motion of the Sun, do reſult from ſome difference between the meridian to which theſe Rules were accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated at the beginning, and of another meridian to which they have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them: ſo that under the meridian ſuppoſed in the II. Section, the new Moon in the <hi>Epocha</hi> arrived at one a Clock 49 minutes in the morning; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meridian which is ſuppoſed in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the X. Section, at the ſame hour of I. and 49 minutes after midnight, the Moon was diſtant from the Sun 37 minutes, which it makes in an hour 13 minutes; therefore under the Meridian ſuppoſed in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the X. Section, the new Moon could not arrive till 3 a Clock 2 minutes after midnight. The meridian to which theſe Rules have been reduced, would therefore be more oriental than the meridian choſen at the beginning by 1 hour 13 minutes, that is to ſay, 18 degrees and a quarter; and having ſuppoſed that they have reduced them to the meridian of <hi>Siam,</hi> they would be accommodated from the beginning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to the meridian of <hi>Narſinga.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What more convinces that this ſubſtraction of 40 minutes from the motion of the Moon, and of three minutes from the motion of the Sun, is cauſed from the difference of the meridians of 1 hour 13 minutes, is that in 1 hour 13 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes the Moon makes 40 minutes, and the Sun 3. 'Tis therefore by the ſame difference of 1 hour 13 minutes, that they have deducted 3 minutes from the motion of the Sun, and 40 minutes from the motion of the Moon.</p>
                        <p>Without this correſpondence of what they have deducted from the motion of the Sun, with what they have taken from the motion of the Moon, which appears to have for foundation the ſame difference of time, and conſequently the ſame difference of meridians, one might have reaſon to believe that the ſubſtraction of theſe 40 minutes has been made a long time after theſe firſt rules; becauſe that it is perceived in proceſs of time, that the motion of the Moon was not exactly ſo quick, as it reſults from the preceding Rules, which do make the lunar month about three quarters of a ſecond ſhorter than the modern Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and this difference amounts to 1 hour and 13 minutes in 450 years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. Thus, if 450 years after the <hi>Epocha</hi> they had compared the firſt rules to the obſervations, one might have judged that the Moon retarded, in reſpect of theſe firſt rules, 1 hour and 13 minutes, or 40 minutes of a degree. But this difference, which is always the ſame, when attributed to the difference of the meridians, would not be always the ſame if it depended on the motion of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98501:114"/>
the Moon, for it would augment one minute to 12 years; to which 'twould be neceſſary to have regard in the Correction of theſe Rules.</p>

                        <p>SEeing that theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules have been brought from <hi>Siam,</hi> and that the Civil year of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> begins in the ſeaſon that we think it ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin according to the Rules of the I. Section, as we ſhall ſhow in the ſequel, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the meridian to which theſe Rules have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the additions mentioned in the VII. and X. Sections, is the meridian of <hi>Siam:</hi> therefore by the calculation which we have made, the new Moon which they have taken for the <hi>Epocha,</hi> muſt happen at 3 a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Siam.</hi> As the lunar month of this method agrees to near a Second with the lunary month eſtabliſhed by all the <hi>European</hi> Aſtronomers, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this hour of the new Moon of the <hi>Epocha</hi> is very preciſe, ſince it may have been deduced from the Obſervations of the Eclipſes of the Moon, which are much more eaſie to determine than all the other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Planets. We may therefore make uſe of the common Tables to ſeek the new Moons which happen'd about the ſeventh Age at three in the morning in the meridian of <hi>Siam,</hi> the difference of which from the meridian of <hi>Paris</hi> is very exactly known to us by ſeveral obſervations of the Eclipſes of the Moon, and the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſent by the King into the Eaſt in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Majeſtie's Mathematicians have made at <hi>Siam,</hi> and by the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Eclipſes made at the ſame time at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Royal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory; by the Compariſon of which Obſervations it is found that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the meridians of theſe two Cities is 6 hours 34 minutes.</p>
                        <p>To this Character of time we might add the Circumſtance of the middle Aequinox of the Spring, which according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the IV. Section, muſt happen at 11 hours 11 minutes after the midnight which followed the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun taken for the <hi>Epocha,</hi> according to what has been ſaid on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the IV. Section, where they deduct 373/800 of a day, that is to ſay, 11 hours and 11 minutes from the days elapſed ſince the <hi>Epocha,</hi> which diſtinguiſhes as much as the <hi>Krommethiapponne,</hi> which we have declared to be the time elapſed from the Suns return to the the point of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> from whence is taken the motion of the Sun and Moon, which muſt be the Aequinoxial point of the Spring.</p>
                        <p>But it muſt not be pretended that the modern Tables do give the very hour of this Aequinox: for they do not exactly agree together in the Aequinoxes, by reaſon of the great difficulty which is found to determine them preciſely. They agree not with the antient Tables of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in the middle Aequinoxes, to near 3 or 4 days: wherefore it is ſufficient that we found by the modern Tables a new Moon to happen at <hi>Siam</hi> at 3 a Clock in the morning, within a day or two of the middle Aequinox of the Spring found by the modern Tables.</p>
                        <p>The place of the Suns <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> which according to what we have drawn from the Rules of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Articles of the VIII. Section, was at the time of the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of the ſign <hi>Gemini,</hi> denotes the Age wherein it is neceſſary to ſeek this new Aequinoxial Moon, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the modern Tables, was about the ſeventh after the Nativity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true that as theſe Rules give not motion to the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> it may be doubted, whether it was not in this degree at the time of the <hi>Epocha,</hi> or at the time of the Obſervations upon which theſe Rules have been made. But the Age of this <hi>Epocha</hi> is likewiſe determined by another Character joyned to the former: 'Tis the place of the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> which according to what we have drawn from the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Articles of the VI.

a motion conformable to that which our Tables do give it; altho they agree not together in the <hi>Epoches</hi> of the <hi>Apogaea,</hi> but to one or two degrees.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the day of the Week muſt be a Saturday in the <hi>Epocha,</hi> ſeeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Section, the firſt day after the <hi>Epocha</hi> was a Sunday; and this circumſtance joyned to what has been ſaid, that the ſame day was near the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, gives the laſt determination to the <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have therefore ſought a new Equinoxial Moon, to which all theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters do agree; and we have found that they agree to the New Moon, which happened in the 638<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year after the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> on the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> according to the <hi>Julian</hi> form, on Saturday at 3 a Clock in the morning, in the Meridian of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This middle conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, according to the <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> Tables which are now moſt uſed, happen'd on this day at <hi>Siam</hi> on the very ſame hour, the reduction of the meridians being made according to our Obſervations: And according to theſe Tables 'twas 16 hours after the middle Aequinox of the Spring; the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> being at 19 degrees ¼ of <hi>Gemini;</hi> the Moon's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> 21 degrees ½ of <hi>Capricorn;</hi> and the Node deſcending from the Moon at 4 degrees of <hi>Aries:</hi> ſo that this Aequinoxial Conjunction had alſo this in particular, that it was Ecliptick, being arrived at ſo little diſtance from one of the Nodes of the Moon.</p>
                        <p>This Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> being thus determined by ſo many Characters, which cannot agree to any other time, by theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules are found the middle Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun about the time of this <hi>Epocha,</hi> with as much exactneſs as by the modern Tables, amongſt which theſe are ſome which for this time do give the ſame middle diſtance between the Sun and the Moon, to one or two minutes, the Reduction being made to the ſame meridian.</p>
                        <p>But from this <hi>Epocha,</hi> as they remove from it, the middle diſtances from the Moon to the Sun found by theſe Rules, do by one minute in twelve years ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs thoſe which the modern Tables do give, as we have before remarked: from whence it may be inferred that if theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules, at the time that they were made, gave the middle diſtances from the Moon to the Sun more exact than they have given them ſince, they have been made very near the time of the <hi>Epocha</hi> eſtabliſhed by theſe Rules.

                        <p>BY the Rules of the firſt Section I judged, that the Civil <hi>Epocha</hi> which is in uſe at the Eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> is different from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> method which we have explained-</p>
                        <p>I have at preſent new aſſurances by ſeveral dates of <hi>Siameſe</hi> Letters, which have been communicated to me by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>De La Loubere,</hi> and by other dates of the Letters which Father <hi>Tachard</hi> publiſhed in his ſecond Voyage, in the year 1687; by which it appears that the Year 1687, was the 2231<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> from the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſe</hi> civil <hi>Epocha,</hi> which conſequently refers to the 544<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whereas by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Rules of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section, and by other Characters of this <hi>Indian</hi> method, it is evident that the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> refers to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Age after the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Civil <hi>Siameſe Epocha</hi> is in the time of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whoſe <hi>dogmata</hi> were conformable to thoſe which the <hi>Indians</hi> have at preſent, and which theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had already in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as <hi>Oneſicritus,</hi> ſent by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> himſelf to treat with the <hi>Indian</hi> Philoſophers, teſtified unto them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the report of <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 15.</p>

                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:98501:116"/>The Letters which the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam</hi> wrote the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1687, were dated according to <hi>Mr. de la Loudere,</hi> in the <hi>eighth month, the firſt day of the decreaſe of the year</hi> Pitoſapſec <hi>of the</hi> Aera 2231. And according to Father <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, the eighth month, the ſecond full Moon of the year</hi> Ihoh napaſoc <hi>of the</hi> Aera 2231. The full Moon happened not till the day following; and the lunary month which then ran, was the third after the Vernal Equinox; the firſt after this Equinox beginning the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> in the ſame year, therefore the firſt month from the Equinox was the ſixth month of the Civil year, which muſt begin the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1686.</p>
                        <p>It appears alſo that the ſame year was Leap-year of 13 months, and that there was one which is not put in the number of the others: for the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame year they reckon'd <hi>the fifteenth day of the eleventh Moon of the year</hi> 2231, and between the full Moon of <hi>June</hi> and that of <hi>October</hi> there were 4 lunar months. Nevertheleſs they reckoned only three, ſeeing that at the full Moon in <hi>June</hi> they reckon'd the eighth month, and at that of <hi>October</hi> they reckon'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the eleventh; there was therefore in this interval of time a Leap-month which is not reckon'd. This Intercalation is likewiſe found by comparing the Letter from the Ambaſſadors with three of the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Letters, of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 22 of the year 1687, recited by Father <hi>Tachardin,</hi> page 282, 287, and 407, which are dated <hi>the</hi> 3d <hi>of the decreaſe of the firſt Moon of the year</hi> 2231: and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that if the Moon of <hi>June</hi> was the eighth Moon of the Civil year 2231, that of <hi>December</hi> was the fourteenth of the ſame Civil year, which is reckon'd for the firſt Moon of the ſucceeding years, tho the year be yet named 2231, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as according to the preceding dates, it ought to be named 2232.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps they chang'd not the name of the Civil year, till it was ſufficiently advanced, and had attained the beginning of the Aſtronomical year: or rather unto this time they do name it after two ways, For another date which Mr. <hi>de la Loubere</hi> communicated unto me, is thus, <hi>the eighth of the encreaſe of the firſt Moon of the Year</hi> 223½. 2. which <hi>is the eleventh of December</hi> 1687. It ſeems that this manner of date denotes that the year may in this month be named either 2231, or 2232: which has relation to the form now uſed in the Northern Countries, where the dates are frequently ſet down in two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the <hi>Julian,</hi> and according to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar; and to the ten firſt days of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year, is ſet a Year more than in the <hi>Julian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By comparing the date of <hi>October</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> which ſuppoſes that the firſt of the Moon was the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month (which day was alſo that of the new Moon) with the other date of <hi>December</hi> the eleventh, which ſuppoſes that the firſt of the Moon was the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month, there are found 59 days in two months, as the motion of the Moon requires. According to theſe dates the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>December</hi> muſt be the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Moon, that is to ſay, the fourth day of the decreaſe, which in the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Letters is ſet down the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the full of the Moon being ſuppoſed on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> which ſhould denote the Intercalation of a daymade to the full of the Moon, unleſs Letters ſhould be antedated one day, or that there is one day wanting in the reſemblance which is made thereof to our Calendar.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the preceeding dates, and ſome others which we have examined, there are only thoſe of <hi>October</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi>December</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that agree well together, and with the motion of the Moon, and in which they take the very day of the Moon's Conjunction with the Sun by the firſt day of the month. The other dates differ ſome days among them; for in thoſe of <hi>June</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they take for the firſt day of the month a day which precedes the Conjunction; on the contrary in the dates of <hi>December</hi> 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> they take for the firſt day of the month a day which follows the Conjunction. Thus the dates which for the firſt day of the Month do take the very day of the Conjunction, may be thought the moſt regular. We have calculated theſe Conjunctions, not only by the modern Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but alſo by the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules, after the manner as we ſhall herein after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and we have found that they agree together in the ſame days of the year.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98501:117"/>Theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules may therefore ſerve to regulate the Calendar of the <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſes,</hi> though they be not at preſent exactly obſerved in the dates of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without a Calendar where the Intercalations of the months and days be regulated according to this method, it would be impoſſible to make uſe of theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules in the Calculation of the Planets, without committing the ſame Error which would be ſlipp'd into the Calendar: unleſs that this Error was known by the exact Hiſtory of the Intercalations, and that regard was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto had in the Calculation.</p>
                        <p>Though by the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules is ſought the number of the months elapſed from one <hi>Epocha,</hi> by the means of a Cycle of 228 ſolar months, ſuppoſed equal to 325 lunar months, which is equivalent to the Cycle of our golden number of nineteen years, in the number of our ſolar and lunar months, which it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends: yet it is ſeen by moſt of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> dates which we have been able to obſerve, that the firſt day of their month, even in this age, is hardly diſtant from the day of the Moons conjunction with the Sun; and that the Calendar of the <hi>Indians</hi> is not run into the Error into which our old Calendar was fallen, where the new Moons were regulated by the Cycle of the golden number, which gives them more ſlow than they are: ſo that ſince they have introduced this Cycle into the Calendar (which was about the fourth Age) to the Age paſt, the error was amounted to above four days. But the <hi>Indians</hi> have avoided this fault; by making uſe of the Rules of the I. Section to find the number of the lunar months; and of the Rules of the II. Section, to find the number of the days and hours which are in this number of months; which being founded on the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the greatneſs of the lunar months, which differs not from the real one, a ſecond cannot want above a day in 8000 years; whereas the Ancient Cycle of our golden number ſuppoſes that in 235 lunar months there are the number of days and hours which are in 19 <hi>Julian</hi> years, which do exceed 235 lunar months one hour 27′; 33″, which do make 5 days in 1563 years.</p>
                        <p>It appears alſo that the Calendar of the <hi>Indians</hi> is very different from that of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who begin their year with the new Moon neareſt the fifteenth of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> according to Father <hi>Martinius;</hi> or the fifth of the ſame Sign, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Father <hi>Couplet</hi> (which happen'd but a month and half, before the Vernal Equinox, and who regulate their Intercalations by a Cycle of ſixty years; which the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> do likewiſe, according to the report of Father <hi>Martinius</hi> in his Relations.</p>

                           <hi>IV.</hi> The Method of comparing the <hi>Siameſe</hi> dates to the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules.</head>
                        <p>TO examine whether the <hi>Siameſe</hi> dates agree with the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules, we have found by theſe Rules the number of the months comprized in the years elapſed from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> and the year current, and we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto added the month of the year current, which we have begun to compute by the ſixth month of the Civil year, for the firſt date which was of the eighth month before the Intercalation of a month; and for the ſecond date which was of the eleventh month, and after the Intercalation of a month, we have begun to compute the months of the current year, with the fifth of the eleven months which were then computed, which is the ſame month that they have reckon'd for the ſixth before the Intercalation of a month, according to the Explication which we have given to the fourth Article of the I. Section.</p>
                        <p>We have done the ſame thing for the following dates, having verified that it is neceſſary to begin to compute from the fifth month, during the reſidue of the Aſtronomical year, and during that which immediately follows the Intercala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And having afterwards calculated the number of the days comprized in theſe ſums of months according to the Rules of the II. Section, we have found that the number of the days found by theſe Rules, agrees with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the days comprehended between the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> of the year
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98501:117"/>
638, and the days of the Conjunctions from whence they have taken the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the months in ſeveral of theſe dates, and particularly in thoſe of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 20, and of <hi>December</hi> 8, which to us have appeared the moſt regular.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98501:118"/>
amongſt which there were 262 Biſſextiles, which give 262 days more than as many common years. In 1049 common years of 365 days, there are 282925 days; and adding thereunto 262 days for the Biſſextiles, there will be 483187 days in 1049 years, as well common as Biſſextile, between <hi>March</hi> 21ſt. of the <hi>Julian</hi> year 638, and <hi>March</hi> 21ſt. of the <hi>Julian</hi> year 1687, which is <hi>March</hi> 31ſt. of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year.</p>

                              <p>To find the ſame number of days by the one and the other method in the Conjunction of <hi>October</hi> of the ſame year 1687, after the Intercalation, which appears, by comparing the date of this month with that of the month of <hi>June</hi> foregoing; it is neceſſary to compute 8 months, beginning with the fifth of of the eleven which were reckon'd. In the Conjunction of <hi>November</hi> are reckon'd 8; and in that of <hi>December,</hi> from whence begins the firſt month of the year 2232, are computed 9, adding 8 months to thoſe of the current year, to the new Moon of the 31ſt. of <hi>March</hi> 1688, from whence began the fifth month of the year 2232. They began to reckon from this 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month during the whole year, which follows the Intercalation, and which was common; and they began to compute from the 6th month only at the new Moon, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the 19th of <hi>April</hi> of this year 1689.

                        <p>HAving by the ſame method calculated, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules, the middle Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun for ſeveral years of this and the following Age, we have always found that every one of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions fell upon a day whereon the middle Conjunction happen'd according to our Tables, but almoſt three hours later than by the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules.</p>
                        <p>By this means we have determined in our Calendar the Terms between which the new Moon muſt happen, from whence it is neceſſary to begin to compute the months of the year current, according to the 4th <hi>Article</hi> of the I. Section; and we have found that in this Age this new Moon is that which happen'd between the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year, which are at preſent the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> and 17th of <hi>April</hi> of the <hi>Julian</hi> year.</p>
                        <p>We have likewiſe found that theſe Terms in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar, do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a day in 239 years, and do go back a day in the <hi>Julian</hi> Calendar in 302 years; which it is neceſſary to know, to be able to make uſe of theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Rules amongſt us.</p>
                        <p>To determine in theſe Calendars the Terms between which the new Moon muſt happen, from whence the Civil year of the <hi>Siameſes</hi> ought to begin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Rules, it is neceſſary to eſtabliſh a Syſtem of common and Biſſextile years well digeſted in the Cycle of 19 years, which Syſtem ſhould be ſuch, that the fifth month of the firſt year after the Biſſextile, and the ſixth month of the other years, do begin in this Age between <hi>March</hi> 28th, and <hi>April</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year.</p>
                        <p>According to this Rule, the Civil year ſhould begin in this Age before the 12th of <hi>December.</hi> For if it begins the 12th the year following, which would begin, <hi>December</hi> 1. would be after the common year, and according to the Rule
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98501:118"/>
they would not begin to reckon from the fifth month, which would happen the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> but with the ſixth month, which would begin the 28th of <hi>April;</hi> which is contrary to what we have found by the Calculation, that in this Age it is neceſſary to begin to compute with the month which begins between <hi>March</hi> 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and <hi>April</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. One might therefore be miſtaken in the uſe of theſe Rules in the years which would begin after <hi>December</hi> 11th of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year.</p>
                        <p>We find likewiſe by our Calculations, that according to theſe very Rules, the <hi>Siameſe</hi> year ſhould begin on the 12th of <hi>December</hi> in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year 1700, which will not be Biſſextile. This will therefore be the moſt advanced Term, that muſt be a whole month diſtant from the preceding Term. Thus the new Moon, which will happen the Age following between the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and the 12th of <hi>December,</hi> will be that from whence according to theſe Rules the Civil year of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> ought to begin.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs we have lately ſeen a date of the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1684, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſuppoſed that the beginning of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> year was at the new Moon, which happen'd the 18th of <hi>December</hi> 1683. This date being compared with thoſe of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam,</hi> wherein it is ſuppoſed that the beginning of the year 2231, was at the new Moon, which happen'd the 16th of <hi>November</hi> 1686, would ſhew that the Terms of the firſt month of the <hi>Siameſe</hi> year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſage of theſe times, are at leaſt 32 days diſtant from each other, altho' according to the Rules, they ought not to be more than a lunary month, or thirty days diſtant.</p>
                        <p>This confirms what we have already remark'd, that in this Age they conform not exactly to theſe Rules in the dates, altho' they differ not much therefrom. But as theſe Rules are obſcure, and that it is neceſſary to ſupply ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which are not diſtinctly expreſſed, it may eaſily happen that the People be miſtaken.</p>
                        <p>Thus after having determined what ſhould be done according to theſe Rules, it is neceſſary to learn from the Relations of Travellers what is actually practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Mean while we know by the dates which we have ſeen, that the preſent Practice is not much different from theſe Rules.</p>

                        <p>EVery one of theſe Terms whereof we have diſcourſed, may be conſider'd as the beginning of a kind of Solar Year, the greatneſs of which is a mean between the <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Gregorian</hi> Year, ſeeing that we have remarked, that in the ſucceſſion of Ages theſe Terms do advance in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Year, and go backward in the <hi>Julian:</hi> the Term which falls at preſent on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> is ſo near the Vernal Aequinox, that it might be ſtiled the Aequinoxial Term, and might be thought the beginning of a Solar Aſtronomical Year.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not poſſible to reconcile together the Rules of divers Sections which ſpeak of the number of the years elapſed from the <hi>Epocha,</hi> under the name of <hi>Aera,</hi> without ſuppoſing divers ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> years.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Aera</hi> is ſpoken of in the I. Section, where we have ſaid that the <hi>Aera</hi> is the number of the years elapſed from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha.</hi> In the ſame Section it is reſolved into ſolar and lunar months; and in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Section the lunar months are reſolved into artificial days of 30 for every lunar month, and into natural days ſuch as are of common uſe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Aera</hi> is likewiſe ſpoken of in the IV. Section, wherein it appears that it is compoſed of a number of thoſe very days which are found in the II. Section; ſo that it would ſeem at firſt, that this was the Syntheſis of the ſame <hi>Aera,</hi> the Analyſis of which is made in the I. and II. Section.</p>
                        <p>But having calculated by the Rules of the I. and II. Section, and by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, of which we ſhall ſpeak, the number of the days that ought to be in 800 years, which number in the IV. Section is ſuppoſed to be 292207, we have there found only the number of 292197 days, 8 hours, and 27 minutes; which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98501:119"/>
is leſs by 9 days, 15 hours, 33 minutes, than that of 292207 days, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the IV. Section, ought to be found in that very number of years. This difference is greater than that which is found between 800 <hi>Julian</hi> years, which conſiſt of 292200 days; and 800 <hi>Gregorian</hi> years, which conſiſt only of 292194 days, the difference of which is 6 days; and in 800 of theſe years, which reſult from the Rules of the two firſt Sections, there is a ſurpluſage above the <hi>Gregorian</hi> years of 13 days, 8 hours, 24 minutes; whereas 800 years of the IV. Section, do 7 days exceed 800 <hi>Julian</hi> years, and 13 days the like number of <hi>Gregorian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Gregorian</hi> is a Tropical year, which conſiſts in the time that the Sun employs in returning to the ſame degree of the Zodiack, which degree is always equally diſtant from the points of the Aequinoxes and Solſtices; there is no doubt that the year drawn from the Rules of the I. and II. Section, does nearer approach the Tropick, than the year drawn from the Rules of the IV. Section, which, as we have remarked, approaches the Aſtral year determined by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Sun to a fixed Star, and the Anomaliſtick determined by the Sun's return to its <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> which ſeveral ancient and modern Aſtronomers diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh not from the Aſtral, no more than the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſuppoſing that the Sun's <hi>Apogaeum</hi> is fixed amongſt the fixed Stars, tho' moſt of the moderns do attribute a little motion to it.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, it appears that the <hi>Indians</hi> make uſe of the Solar year of the IV. Section, as we make uſe of the Tropick, when according to the Rules of the VII, VIII, X and XI. Sections, they calculated the place of the Sun and his <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and of the Moon and her <hi>Apogaeum.</hi> For the time elapſed from the end of this year called <hi>Krommethiapponne,</hi> ſerves them to find the Signs, Degrees and Minutes of the middle motion of the Sun. They ſuppoſe then that this year conſiſts in the Sun's return to the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack like our Tropical year.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that at preſent the Signs of the Zodiack are taken amongſt us in two ways, which were not formerly diſtinguiſhed. When the Ancients had obſerved the tract of the Sun's motion thro' the Zodiack, which they had divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four equal parts by the points of the Aequinoxes and Solſtices; and that they had ſubdivided every fourth part into three equal parts, which in all do make the 12 Signs, they obſerved the Conſtellations formed of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fixed Stars, which fell in every one of theſe Signs, and they gave to the Signs the name of the Conſtellations which are there found, not ſuppoſing then that the ſame fixed Stars would ever quit their Signs.</p>
                        <p>But in the ſucceſſion of Ages, it is found that the ſame fixed Stars were no more in the ſame degrees of the Signs, whether that the Stars were advanced towards the Eaſt in regard of the points of the Aequinoxes and Solſtices, or that theſe very points were removed from the ſame fixed Stars towards the Weſt; and it is now found that a fixed Star paſſes from the beginning of one Sign to the beginning of another in about 2200 years.</p>
                        <p>Therefore ſeeing that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in the ſecond Age of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> confirmed this as yet doubtful diſcovery, which had been made three Ages before by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus;</hi> there is a diſtinction made between the Zodiack, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led local, which begins from the Aequinoxial point of the Spring, and is divided into 12 Signs, and the Aſtral Zodiack compoſed of 12 Conſtellations, which do ſtill retain the ſame name, tho' at preſent the Conſtellation of <hi>Aries</hi> has paſſed into the Sign of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and that the ſame thing has happen'd to the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations which have paſſed into the following Signs.</p>
                        <p>Yet the Aſtronomers do ordinarily refer the places and motions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to the local Zodiack, becauſe it is important to know how they refer to the Aequinoxes and Solſtices, on which depends their diſtance from the Aequinoxial and Poles, the various magnitude of the Days and Nights, the diverſity of the Seaſons, and ſome other Circumſtances, the knowledg of which is of great uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Copernicus</hi> is almoſt the ſole perſon amongſt our Aſtronomers, who refers the places and motions of the Planets to the Aſtral Zodiack, by reaſon that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98501:119"/>
that the fixed Stars are immoveable, and that the Anticipation of the Aequinoxes and Solſtices, is only an appearance cauſed by a certain motion of the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth. But they who follow his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ceaſe not to denote the places of the Planets, in regard of the points of the Aequinoxes in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Zodiack, by reaſon of the Conſequences of this Situation which we have remarked.</p>
                        <p>'Twould be an admirable thing that the <hi>Indians</hi> who follow the <hi>Dogmata</hi> of the <hi>Pythagoraeans,</hi> ſhould herein conform to the method of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> who is the reſtorer of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Pythagoraeans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet there is no appearance that they deſigned to refer the places of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets rather to any fixed Star, than to the Aequinoxial point of the Spring. For it ſeems that they would have choſen for this purpoſe ſome principal fixed Star, as <hi>Copernicus</hi> has done, who, for the Principle of his Zodiack, has choſen the Point to which refers the Longitude of the firſt Star of <hi>Aries,</hi> which was found in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> where was the Aequinoxial Point of the Spring, when the Aſtronomers began to place the fix'd Stars in regard of the Points of the Aequinoxes and Solſtices.</p>
                        <p>But at the place of the Heavens, where the <hi>Indians</hi> place the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack according to the IV. Section, and the following Sections, there is not any conſiderable Star; there are only thereabouts ſome of the ſmalleſt and moſt obſcure Stars of the Conſtellation of <hi>Piſces,</hi> but it is the place where was the Aequinoxial Point at the time of their Aſtronomical <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> from whence the fixed Stars advanced afterwards towards the Eaſt; ſo that the Sun, by its annual motion, returns not to the ſame fixed Star till about 20 minutes after its return to the ſame Point of the local Zodiack. It was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to perceive this little difference in few years to the Ancients, who did not immediately compare the Sun to the fixed Stars, as it is at preſent compared, and who compared only the Sun to the Moon during the day, and the Moon to the fixed Stars during the night, tho' from the day to the night the Moon changes place amongſt the fixt Stars, as well by its own motion, which is quick and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, as by its <hi>Parallax,</hi> which was not well known to the Ancients. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they very lately only perceived the difference that there is between the Tropical year, during which the Sun returns to the Points of the Aequinoxes and the Solſtices, and the Aſtral year during which it returns to the ſame fixed Stars; and then they had a Solar year of 365 days and a quarter, which is found at preſent to be the mean between the Tropical and the Aſtral, and that it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the Tropical by 11 minutes, and is ſhorter than the Aſtral by 9 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>

                           <hi>VII.</hi> The Determination of the Magnitude of the two ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> Years.</head>
                        <p>IT is eaſie to find the greatneſs of the year which is ſuppoſed in the IV. Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by dividing 292207 days by 800 years, each of which is found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of 365 days, 6 hours, 12′, 36″.</p>
                        <p>It is a little more difficult to find that which reſults from the I. and II. Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which it is neceſſary to ſupply ſome Rules which are there wanting, to be able to make this uſe thereof. For in the I. Section it is ſuppoſed that the years are compoſed of entire lunar months, and that the number of the months which remain, is known beſides: And in the II. Section it is ſuppoſed that the entire months have been found by the I. Section, and that the number of the days which remain, is known beſides: yet a number of ſolar years, which is not but very rarely compoſed of entire lunar months, muſt have not only the number of the months, but alſo the number of the days determin'd. Indeed, we find that theſe Rules do tacitly ſuppoſe a ſolar year compoſed of months, days, hours and minutes, which regulate the luniſolar years.</p>
                        <p>The way of finding it by theſe Rules, is to reſolve a year into ſolar and lunar months, by the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Rules of the I. Section, and not to neglect the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98501:120"/>
fraction which remains after the diviſion made by the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the ſame Section; but to reduce it into days, hours, minutes and ſeconds, or into the decimal parts of a month, going to a thouſand millions, to prepare it for the operations which muſt be performed according to the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> rules of the II. Section, as well for this fraction, as for the whole months; and in fine, to reduce after the ſame manner the fraction called <hi>Anamaan</hi> in the II. Section.</p>
                        <p>After a plainer manner may likewiſe be found the greatneſs of this year, by making uſe of the <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> which we have infolded in theſe two Sections, to find a period of years, which ſhould be compoſed of a number of intire lunar months, and likewiſe of a number of intire days.</p>
                        <p>By ſuppoſing, according to our explication of the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the II. Section, that a lunar month is equal to 30 artificial days, and that 703 artificial days are equal to 692 natural days, it will be found that in 703 lunar months there are 20760<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> natural days; and adding thereunto the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the I. Section, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the number of 228 ſolar months which do make 19 years) are equal to 235 lunar months, it will be found that in 13357 ſolar years there are 165205 entire lunar months, which do make 4878600 natural days, from whence it reſults that a lunar month, according to theſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> conſiſts of 29 days, 12 hours, 44′, 2″, 23‴, 23″″, and the ſolar year of 365 days, 5 hours, 55′, 13″, 46‴, 5″″.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Indian</hi> year conceal'd in the tacit <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of theſe two Sections, agrees within two ſeconds with the tropical year of <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of 365 days, 5 hours, 55′, 12″; and to near 13 ſeconds with that of <hi>Rabbi Adda</hi> an Author of the third Age, which conſiſts of 365 days, 5 hours, 55′, 26″. If it could be verified that theſe years and theſe months, had been determined by the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Obſervations of the Sun, independently from the Weſtern Aſtronomy, this agreemet of ſeveral Aſtronomers, of different Nations, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote one from the other, would ſerve to prove that the Tropical year has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently been of this bigneſs, though at preſent it is found leſſer by 6 minutes, which in 10 years do make an hour, and in 240 years a whole day. But it is probable that this greatneſs of the year has been determined only by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Eclipſes and other Moons, and by the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that Nineteen ſolar years are equal to Two hundred thirty five lunar months; which <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſo nearly approaches the truth, that it was difficult to obſerve the difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but in the ſucceſſion of Ages; which prevented <hi>Hipparacus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> from departing therefrom in the determination of the greatneſs of the ſolar year.</p>

                           <hi>VIII.</hi> The Antiquity of theſe two ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> years.</head>
                        <p>WE have not a more preciſe knowledge of the <hi>Indian</hi> years, than that which we have drawn from theſe Rules. <hi>Scaliger</hi> who has carefully collected all the Memoirs that he could gather from the ancient Authors, from the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> from the Miſſionaries, and different Travellers, and who has inſerted them, not only in his work <hi>de Emendatione temporum,</hi> but alſo in his Commentaries upon <hi>Manilius,</hi> and in his <hi>Iſagoge Chronologica,</hi> judging that theſe Memoirs might pleaſe all thoſe that have any curioſity for Learning, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes nothing thereon which ſatisfies <hi>Patavius;</hi> and it is certain, that <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s <hi>Indian</hi> year refers neither to the one nor the other of thoſe which we have now found.</p>
                        <p>But in the Cardinal <hi>de Cuſa</hi>'s Treatiſe of the Calendar, there are ſome <hi>veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> of theſe two ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> years. That which we have drawn from the IV. Section, is there found almoſt in formal terms; that which we have drawn from the Compariſon of the I. and II. Section is found there alſo, but after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo obſcure, that the Author himſelf who relates it has not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                        <p>This Cardinal ſays, that according to <hi>Abraham Aven Ezra,</hi> an Aſtronomer of the Twelfth Age, the <hi>Indians</hi> do add (to the year of 365 days) the fourth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98501:120"/>
part of a day, and the fifth part of an hour, when they ſpeak of the year in which the Sun returns to the ſame Star. This year conſiſts then of 365 days, 6 hours, and 12′; and it agrees to near 36 ſeconds with the year that we found by the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the IV. Section. This Author adds, that they who ſpeak of the year according to which the <hi>Indians</hi> do regulate their Feaſts, do alledge that from the fourth part there reſults a day more in 320 years. <hi>Ex quarta plus</hi> 320 <hi>annis diem exurgere:</hi> which he explains after a manner which cannot ſubſiſt. <hi>This year,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is greater than our common year, by one fourth,</hi> 23 <hi>ſeconds, and</hi> 30 <hi>thirds, which in</hi> 353 <hi>years do make a day.</hi> The means of drawing a reaſonable ſenſe from this explication is not evident. For a day divided in three hundred fifty three years gives to each year 4 minutes, 4″, 45‴; and not 23″, 30‴. The true ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Ex quarta plus</hi> 320 <hi>annis diem exurgere,</hi> is in my opinion, that 320 years of 365 days and a quarter, do by one whole day ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs 320 of theſe <hi>Indian</hi> years. One day divided in 320 years, gives to each 4 minutes, 30 ſeconds; which being deducted from 365 and a quarter, do leave 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, and 30 ſeconds; which will be the greatneſs of the year, which regulates the <hi>Indian</hi> Feaſts. This year exceeds not but by 16 ſeconds, the greatneſs of the year, which we have found by the compariſon of the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the I. and II. Section of the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules: wherefore there is no reaſon to doubt but it is this which is here treated of.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THis ſort of ſolar years, drawn from the rules of the two firſt Sections, may be called Synodical, becauſe that it reſults from the Equality which is ſuppoſed to be between 19 of theſe ſolar years, and 235 lunar months, which terminate at the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. For the <hi>Epocha</hi> of theſe years may be taken the day and hour of the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. which happen'd the very day of the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha,</hi> to near a day of the middle Equinox of the Spring; tho ſome may infer from the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles of the II. Section, that for the <hi>Epocha</hi> of theſe years they take the minute which immediately follows this middle Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the Meridian to which the rules of this Section were accommodated. Thus in particular calculations, there will be no more need of the Operation preſcribed in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the II. Section, which is founded on the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which was between the inſtant of this middle Conjunction and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night following, at a particular Meridian more occidental than <hi>Siam;</hi> nor of the Operations preſcribed in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the VII. Section, and at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the X. Section, which we have judged to denote the minutes of the motion of the Sun and Moon, between the Meridian of <hi>Siam,</hi> and the Meridian to which the rules of the II. Section had been accommodated; and it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to have had regard to theſe three Articles once for all.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Epocha</hi> of theſe Synodical years will therefore be the 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>March</hi> in the 638<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at 3 a clock, 2 minutes in the morning at the Meridian of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The greatneſs of theſe years, according to the VII. Chapter of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, conſiſting of 365 days, 5 hours, 55′, 13″, 46‴, 5″″, we ſhall find the beginning of the following years in the <hi>Julian</hi> years, by the continual addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 5 hours, 55′, 13″, 46‴, 5″″, deducting a day from the ſumm of the days which reſults from this addition in the Biſſextile years; thus we ſhall find the beginnings of theſe ſolar Synodical years, the dates of which we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd as we have here calculated them, at the Meridian of <hi>Siam</hi> with the hours computed after midnight.</p>

                           <p>TO know the firſt Conjunctions of the ſolar ſynodical <hi>Indian</hi> years in our Calendar, it is ſufficient to calculate the beginnings of the year from 19 to 19 years after the <hi>Èpocha.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="213" facs="tcp:98501:121"/>For every nineteenth ſolar ſynodical year from the <hi>Epocha</hi> ends with the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, from whence begins the twentieth year. The greatneſs of this period is found by reſolving 19 years into lunar months by the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles of the I Section, and by reſolving the lunar months into days by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles of the II Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in fine, by reducing the fraction of the days called <hi>Anamaan,</hi> into hours, minutes, ſeconds and thirds: and by this means it will be found that the <hi>Indian</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of 19 years, conſiſts of 6939 days, 16 hours, 29 minutes, 21 ſeconds, 35 thirds.</p>
                           <p>Tho this <hi>Indian</hi> Period of 19 years agrees in the number of the lunar months, which it comprehends, with the periods of <hi>Numa, Meton,</hi> and <hi>Calippus,</hi> and with our Cycle of the Golden number, as we have remarked in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the I. Section; yet it is different in the number of the hours.</p>
                           <p>That of <hi>Meto</hi> which contains 6940 days is longer by 7 hours, 30 minutes, 38 ſeconds, 25 thirds, than the <hi>Indian.</hi> That of <hi>Calippus</hi> and of our golden number which contain 6939 days and 18 hours, are longer by 1 hour, 30 minutes, 38 ſeconds, 25 thirds, than the <hi>Indian.</hi> That of <hi>Numa</hi> muſt be of a number of whole days, according to <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> whoſe words are theſe: <hi>Ad curſum Lunae in duodecim menſes deſcribit annum, quem (quia tricenos dies ſingulis menſibus Luna non explet, deſuntque dies ſolido anni, qui ſolstitiali circumagitur orbe) intercalares menſibus interponendo, ita diſpenſavit, ut vigeſimo anno ad metam eandem ſolis unde orſi eſſent, plenis annorum ſpatiis dies congruerent.</hi> In all the Manuſcripts that we have ſeen, it is read <hi>viceſimo anno,</hi> and not <hi>vigeſimo quarto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> as in ſome printed Copies.</p>
                           <p>The period of 19 years of the <hi>Indians</hi> is therefore more exact than theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the Ancients, and than our golden Cycle; and it agrees to 3 minutes, and 5 or 6 ſeconds with the period of 235 lunar months eſtabliſhed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, which do make it of 6939 days, 16 hours, 13 minutes, 27 ſeconds.</p>
                           <p>This is the beginning of the current <hi>Indian</hi> period of 19 years, and of the reſt which follow for above an Age in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar, at the Meridian of <hi>Siam,</hi> with the hours after midnight.</p>

                           <p>If the luniſolar years are ordered after this manner, they will always end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſynodical Equinox, or in the Equinox it ſelf. But they may be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they end always after the ſynodical Equinox: which will happen, if when the <hi>Epact</hi> is 0, they begin them with the new Moon, which happens a month after the ſynodical Equinox: and after this manner the firſt month of the Aſtronomical year will commence at the beginning of the fifth month of the Civil year after the Emboliſme; whereas in the year of the firſt method, the firſt month would end at the beginning of the fifth month of the Civil year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emboliſme.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Indian Epact</hi> is a great deal more exact than our vulgar <hi>Epact,</hi> which augments 11 days by the year; ſo that they deduct 30 days, when it exceeds this number, taking 30 days for a lunar month, and the nineteenth year they ſubſtract 29 days to reduce the <hi>Epocha</hi> to nothing at the end of the nineteenth luniſolar year.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Epact of a month, being reduced to hours, conſiſts of 21 hours 45′, 33″, 46‴. The <hi>Epact</hi> of a year conſiſts of 10 days, 21 hours, 6′, 45″. The <hi>Epact</hi> of 3 years is 3 days, 2 hours, 36 minutes, 13 ſeconds. The <hi>Epact</hi> of 11 years which is the leaſt of all in the Cycle of 19 years, is 1 day, 13 hours, 18′, 7″.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Indian Epact</hi> may be conſider'd in reſpect of the <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Gregorian</hi> years: and it will ſerve to find the beginning of the Civil and Aſtronomical years of the <hi>Indians</hi> in our Calendar, after they ſhall have eſtabliſhed an <hi>Epocha</hi> and denoted the Terms.</p>
                           <p>From a Common or Biſſextile year, to the ſucceeding common, <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Gregorian</hi> year, the <hi>Indian Epact</hi> conſiſts of 10 days, 15 hours, 11′. 32″.</p>
                           <p>From a common year to the following Biſſextile year, the <hi>Indian Epact</hi> is 11 days, 15 hours, 11′, 32″.</p>
                           <p>The annual <hi>Epact</hi> muſt be ſubſtracted from the firſt new Moon of a year, to find the firſt new Moon of the following year.</p>
                           <p>But when after the Subſtraction, the new Moon precedes the Term; they add a month to the year to make it Emboliſmic. Thus having ſuppoſed the firſt new Moon after the ſynodical Equinox of the year 1683, as in Chapter IX, on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 22 hours, and 41 minutes after noon, that is to ſay, on the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> at 10 a clock, 41 minutes of the morning in the Meridian of <hi>Siam:</hi> to have the firſt new Moon of the following year 1684, which is Biſſextile, they will ſubſtract from this time 11 days, 15 hours, 11 minutes, 32 ſeconds, and they will have the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> at 19 hours, 29 minutes, 28 ſeconds of the year 1684: and to have the firſt new Moon of the ſolar ſynodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal year, of the year 1685, which is common, they will ſubſtract from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding days, 10 days, 15 hours, 11 minutes 32 ſeconds; and they will have the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> at 4 hours, 17 minutes, 56 ſeconds.</p>
                           <p>In fine, to have the firſt new Moon of the ſolar ſynodical year of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year 1686, which is common, deducting likewiſe the ſame number of days, they will have the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> at 13 hours, 6 minutes, 24 ſeconds. But becauſe that this day precedes the term of the ſynodical years, which for this Age hath been found the 27th of <hi>March;</hi> it is neceſſary to add a lunar month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 3 ſeconds; thus the year will be Emboliſmic of 13 Moons, and they will have the firſt new Moon of the ſynodical <hi>Indian</hi> year the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> at 1 hour, 50 minutes, 27 ſeconds in the morning at <hi>Siam,</hi> and continuing after the ſame manner, they will have all the firſt new Moons of the following years.</p>
                           <p>In theſe <hi>Indian</hi> rules the name of an Emboliſmick or <hi>Attikamaat,</hi> agrees to the year which immediately follows the Intercalation.</p>
                           <p>The luniſolar years may likewiſe be order'd in ſuch a manner, that the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the intercalary month may be made when the Epact exceeds 114/228, which do make the half of the month; to the end that the term might be as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um between the ſeveral beginnings of the years, ſome of which commence ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98501:122"/>
and others later; as it is practiſed in our Eccleſiaſtical years, which began before the Vernal Equinox, when the Equinox arrives before the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Moon; and which begin after the Equinox, when the Equinox happens after the 14th of the Moon. But it is more commodious for the Aſtronomical Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations to begin the year always before, or always after the Equinox, as it is practiſed in the Aſtronomical <hi>Indian</hi> year, according to our Explication.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheleſs it is neceſſary to remark that the point of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which the <hi>Indians</hi> do take for the beginning of the ſigns, according to the Rules of the IV. and following Sections, and which they conſider in ſome ſort as the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxial point of the Spring, is in this Age removed 13 degrees from the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Term of the years diſcourſed of in the I. Section; ſo that the Sun ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives there the fourteenth day after the ſynodical Aequinox. Wherefore a part of the Aſtronomical luniſolar years which begin after the Term eſtabliſhed by the Rules of the I. Section, will begin in this Age before this ſort of Aequinox: and the other part will begin after; ſo that this ſort of Aequinox is as it were in the middle of the ſeveral beginnings of the luniſolar years which begin in the fifth and ſixth month of the Civil year.</p>

                           <p>In the year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 1688, the number of the years elapſed from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> is 1050. This number being divided by 6, the Quotient, which is 175, gives 175 minutes, that is to ſay 2 hours, 55 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to add.</p>
                           <p>This ſame number being divided by 4, the quotient is 262, which gives 262 ſeconds, that is to ſay 6 minutes, 22 ſeconds to ſubſtract; and the Equation will be 2 hours, 48 minutes, 38 ſeconds. Having added this Equation to the firſt Conjunction of the ſolar Synodical year 1051, which, according to theſe rules, happen'd the 31ſt of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1688, at 19 hours, 28 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, 24 ſeconds, after midnight; the middle Conjunction will be the 31ſt of <hi>March,</hi> at 22 hours, 17 minutes, 12 ſeconds, at the Meridian of <hi>Siam.</hi> The ſame Equation ſerves to the Synodical years which reſult from the time of 235 lunar months divided into 19 years.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IF the <hi>Indians</hi> take for a Tropical year the time which the Sun employs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack, according to the fourth and following Sections; the difference between theſe years and the Synodical is conſiderable, as we have already remark'd. According to the Weſtern Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, the beginning of the Signs is the point of the Vernal Equinox, where the aſcending demicircle of the Zodiack, terminated by the Tropicks, is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98501:123"/>
by the Equinoxial; for they hold no more to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who plac'd the Equinoxes at the eighth parts of the Signs: and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical year is the time that the Sun employs in returning to the ſame point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Equinoxial or Tropical.</p>
                        <p>The Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun, which happen in the points of the Equinoxes, return not preciſely at the end of the nineteenth Tropical year: for this nineteenth year ends about two hours before the end of the 235<hi rend="sup">th</hi> lunar month, which terminates the nineteenth Synodical year.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, about two hours: for in this the modern Aſtronomers agree not among themſelves to 9 or 10 minutes, becauſe that the time of the Equinoxes being very difficult to determine exactly, they agree not in the exactneſs of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical year but to near half a minute; tho they be almoſt unanimouſly agreed even to the thirds, in the greatneſs of the lunar month. Thoſe that do make the greatneſs of the Tropical year of 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 4 ſeconds, and 36 thirds, will have the period of 19 ſolar Synodical years above two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act hours longer than the period of 19 Tropical years: They that make the Tropical year longer, will have a leſſer difference; and they that make the Tropical year ſhorter, as moſt of the Aſtronomers do at preſent, will have it greater. It may here be ſuppoſed that this difference would be 2 hours want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 3 minutes, ſeeing that the defect of the lunar <hi>Indian</hi> months in 19 years is 3 minutes; and that the Tropical year would conſiſt of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 55 ſeconds. Thus, if at every 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year from the Aſtronomical <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> they deduct 2 hours from the Equinoxial Term, calculated by the <hi>Indian</hi> rules without the correction; and if they deduct alſo 14 hours 46 minutes for the time by which it may be ſuppoſed that the middle Equinox precedes the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the new Moons, according to the modern <hi>Hypotheſes;</hi> they will have the middle Equinox of the Spring of the year propoſed ſince the <hi>Epocha,</hi> conformable to the modern <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi>

                        <p>IN the VII. Chapter of theſe Reflexions we have found, that the Period of 13357 years is compoſed of 165205 entire lunar months, which do make 4878600 whole days, according to the Rules of the II. Section. This Period according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of theſe Rules, brings back the new Moons which terminate the <hi>Indian</hi> ſynodical years, to the ſame hour and to the ſame minute under the ſame Meridian.</p>
                        <p>But having examined it by the method of the XII. Chapter of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, it will be found that it is ſhorter than a period of a like number of lunar months, according to the modern Aſtronomers, by 1 day and 14 hours, which is almoſt the Epact of 11 years: and by the method of the XIII. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be found that the Anticipation of the Aequinoxes in regard of this number of ſynodical years of the <hi>Indians</hi> is 54 days and 5 hours. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench 11 years from this period, there will be one of 13346 years, compoſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98501:123"/>
of 165069 lunar months, or of 4874564 days, which will be more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the modern <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>

                        <p>BUt inſtead of correcting the great period foregoing, it is more proper to find out a much ſhorter, which brings back the new Moons and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxes to the ſame hour under the ſame Meridian, thereby to eſtabliſh ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi>'s more near, and to abridge the Calculations which are ſo much the longer, as the <hi>Epocha</hi>'s are more diſtant from our time.</p>
                        <p>It is extreamly difficult, or rather it is impoſſible to find ſome ſhort and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe periods, which conjunctly reduce the new Moons and the Equinoxes to the ſame Meridian. <hi>Vieta</hi> propoſes one for the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar of 165580000 years, which comprehends 2047939047 lunar months.</p>
                        <p>It is not poſſible to verifie the exactneſs of theſe periods by the compariſon of the Obſervations that we have, the ancienteſt of which are only of 25 Ages; and theſe long periods ſerve not our deſign, which is to bring the <hi>Epocha</hi>'s nearer.</p>
                        <p>It is better to make uſe of the ſhorteſt, tho leſs exact periods, and to denote how they want of being exact according to the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which we follow.</p>
                        <p>By the rules of the firſt Section, and by our additions, it is found that 1040 ſynodical <hi>Indian</hi> years do make 12863 lunar months, and 157851/1000000; and by the rules of the II. Section it is found that this number of 12863 months without the fraction makes 379851 days, 21 hours, 24 minutes, 19 ſeconds.</p>
                        <p>According to the correction made by the method of the XII. Chapter of theſe Reflexions, to this number of days it is neceſſary to add 2 hours and 49 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, to render it conformable to the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Modern Aſtronomers: thus in this number of 12863 months, there are 379852 whole days, and 13 minutes, 19 ſeconds of an hour.</p>
                        <p>The ſame number of months, with the fraction according to the Rules of the II. Section, and according to our additions, makes 379856 days, 13 hours, 16 minutes, 43 ſeconds; which do make 1040 ſynodical <hi>Indian</hi> years.</p>
                        <p>The difference by which theſe years exceed the Tropical years, by our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the XIII Chapter of theſe Reflexions, is found of 4 days, 13 hours, 28 minutes, 25 ſeconds; and this difference being deducted from 379856 days, 13<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 16′, 43″, there remains 379851 days, 23 hours, 48 minutes, 28 ſeconds, for 1040 Tropical years, and to make 379852 whole days, there wants only 11 minutes and 32 ſeconds, during which the proper motion of the Sun is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the III. Chapter of theſe Reflexions we have remarked, that the <hi>Siameſes</hi> in their dates make uſe of an <hi>Epocha,</hi> which precedes the year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by 544 years, and that after the twelfth or thirteenth month of the years from this <hi>Epocha,</hi> which do now end in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> the firſt month which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and which muſt be attributed to the following year, is yet attributed to the ſame year: which has given us ground to conjecture, that they attribute alſo to the ſame year, the other months to the beginning of the Aſtronomical year, which begins at the Vernal Equinox. This conjecture has been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the report of Mr. <hi>de la Loubere,</hi> who likewiſe judges that this Ancient <hi>Epocha</hi> muſt alſo be an Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The extraordinary manner of computing the firſt and ſecond month of the ſame year after the twelfth or thirteenth, may cauſe a belief that the firſt month of theſe years, which begins at preſent in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> began anciently near the Vernal Equinox, and that in proceſs of time, the <hi>Indians,</hi> either thro negligence, or to make uſe of a Cycle too ſhort, as would be that of 60 years which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do uſe, have ſometimes failed to add a thirteenth month to the year which ought to be Emboliſmick, whence it has happen'd that the firſt month has run back into the winter; which having been perceived, the winter months, now called firſt, ſecond and third, have been attributed to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding year, which according to the ancient inſtitution ought not to end but at Spring.</p>
                        <p>Thus the <hi>Indian</hi> year, which was called 2231, at the end of the year 1687 of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ought not to end, according to the Ancient Inſtitution, till the Spring of the year 1688. Having ſubſtracted 1688 from 2231, there remains 543, which is the number of the compleat years from the ancient <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to the year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>Epocha</hi> appertains therefore to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent year 544 before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to the moſt common way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting.</p>
                        <p>In this year the middle conjunction of the Moon happened between the true Equinox, and the middle Equinox of the Spring, at 15 degrees diſtance from the North Node of the Moon, the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> according to the <hi>Julian</hi> form, a <hi>Saturday,</hi> which is an Aſtronomical <hi>Epocha</hi> almoſt like to that of the year 638, which has been choſen, as more modern and more preciſe than the former.</p>
                        <p>Between theſe two <hi>Indian Epocha</hi>'s there is a period of 1181 years, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to a period of 19 years, there are two periods of 600 years, which reduce the new Moons near the Equinoxes.</p>

                        <p>ACcording to the Chronology of <hi>China</hi> which Father <hi>Couplet</hi> publiſhed, and according to Father <hi>Martinius</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>China,</hi> the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do make uſe of luniſolar years, and they deſtribute them into ſexagenary Cycles, the 74<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of which began in the year of <hi>J.

                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:98501:125"/>By the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules of the firſt Section, in 60 ſynodical years, there are 720 ſolar months, and 742 lunar months, and 24/228 It is neceſſary to reject this fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that the luniſolar years are compoſed of entire lunar months. Yet this fraction in 19 ſexagenary Cycles, which do make 1140 years, amounts to 456/22<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> which do make two months: therefore if the ſexagenary Cycles of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are all uniform, 1140 <hi>Chineſe</hi> years are ſhorter by two months, than 1140 ſynodical years of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Wherefore if the <hi>Indians</hi> have regulated the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalations of their civil years by uniform ſexagenary Cycles, the beginning of the civil year 2232, ought to precede by a little leſs than four months, the term of their ſynodical years, which is at preſent on the 27 of <hi>March</hi> of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year; as it happened indeed; which confirms what we have conjectured in the foregoing Chapter of the anticipation of the civil years.</p>
                        <p>To equal the years of the ſexagenary Cycle to the ſynodical years regulated according to the Cycle of 19 years, it would be neceſſary that among 19 ſexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genary Cycles there were 17 of 742 lunar months, and 2 of 743; or rather it would be neceſſary that after 9 Cycles of 742 months, which do make 740 years, the tenth Cycle following, which would be accompliſh'd in the year 600, was of 743 months.</p>
                        <p>But there is ground to doubt whether they uſe it thus, ſeeing that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> year has ſeveral times had occaſion of being reformed, to refer its beginning to the ſame term; in which nevertheleſs the modern Relations accord only to 10 degrees: Father <hi>Martinius</hi> denoting it at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Couplet</hi> at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Sign; as if the Term had retreated 10 degrees ſince the time of Father <hi>Martinius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is unqueſtionable that a great part of the Eclipſes, and of the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do give as obſerved, cannot have happened at the times that they pretend, according to the Calendar regulated after the manner as it is at preſent, as we have found by the Calculation of a great number of theſe Eclipſes, and even by the ſole examination of the Intervals which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked between the one and the other: for ſeveral of theſe Intervals are too long, or too ſhort, to be poſſibly determined by the Eclipſes, which do happen only when the Sun is near one of the Nodes of the Moon; where it could not poſſibly return at the times denoted, if the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years had been regulated in the paſt ages, as they are at preſent. Father <hi>Couplet</hi> himſelf doubts of ſome of theſe Eclipſes, by reaſon of the Compliment which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Aſtronomers made to one of their Kings, whom they congratulated, for that an Eclipſe, which they had predicted, had not hapned; the Heaven, they ſaid, having ſpared him this misfortune: and this Father has left to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thevenot</hi> a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the ſame Eclipſes, which he has printed in his Chronology, entituled <hi>Eclipſes verae &amp; falſae,</hi> without diſtinguiſhing the one from the other.</p>
                        <p>But without accuſing the <hi>Chineſes</hi> of falſhood, it may be ſaid, that it may be that the Eclipſes ſet down in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Chronology might happen, and that the contradiction which appears therein may proceed from the Irregularity of their Calendar, on which no Foundation can be laid.</p>

                           <hi>XXI.</hi> A Compoſition of the luniſolar Periods.</head>
                        <p>THE Interval between the two <hi>Epocha</hi>'s of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which is 1181 years, is a luniſolar period, which reduces the new Moons near the Equinox, and to the ſame day of the week.</p>
                        <p>This period is compoſed of 61 periods of 29 years, which are longer than 1159 tropical years; and of two periods of 11 years, which are ſhorter than 22 tropical; the defect of the one, partly recompencing the exceſs of the others.</p>
                        <p>As the mixture of the luniſolar years, ſome longer, others ſhorter, than the tropical, does more or leſs recompence the defect of the one by the exceſs of the other, as far as the Incommenſurability which may be between the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98501:125"/>
of the Sun and Moon permits it: It makes the luniſolar periods ſo much the more preciſe, as they reduce the new Moons nearer the places of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack where they arrived at the beginning.</p>
                        <p>The Antients have firſt made the tryal of the little periods, the moſt famous of which has been that of 8 years, which has been in uſe not only amongſt the ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> but alſo amongſt the firſt Chriſtians; as it appears by the Cycle of St. <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> publiſhed at the beginning of the third Age.</p>
                        <p>This period, compoſed of five ordinary and three Emboliſmick years, being found too long by a day and half, which in 20 periods do make above a month; they were obliged to retrench a month in the twentieth period. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the period of 8 years was joyned to another of eleven years, compoſed of ſeven ordinary and four Emboliſmick, which is too ſhort about a day and a half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereof was made the period of 19 years, which was ſuppoſed at firſt to be exact, tho it has ſince had occaſion of amendment in the number of the days and hours which it comprehends. The correction of this period was the origine of the period of 76 years, compoſed of 4 periods of 19 years, corrected by <hi>Callippus,</hi> and of the period of 304 years, compoſed of 16 periods of 19 years, corrected by <hi>Hipparchus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had a period of 84 years, compoſed of four periods of 19 years, and one of 8 years, which reduces the new Moons near the Aequinox on the ſame day of the week.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt famous period of thoſe which have been invented to reduce the new Moons to the ſame place of the Zodiack, and to the ſame day of the week, is the <hi>Victorian</hi> of 532 years, compoſed of 28 periods of 19 years.</p>
                        <p>Yet the new Moon which ſhould terminate this period, happen'd not till two days after the Sun's return to the ſame point of the Zodiack, and two other days before the ſame day of the week, to which the conjunction was arrived at the beginning of the period; and theſe defects are multiplied in the ſucceſſion of the times, according to the number of theſe periods. Nevertheleſs, after that the defects of this period were known by every one, ſeveral famous Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers have not ceaſed to make uſe thereof, and they terminate it on the ſame day of the week and on the ſame day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year, which in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time exceeds the ſolar tropical year 4 whole days, and the luniſolar year ſomewhat leſs than two days.</p>
                        <p>They do alſo multiply this period by the Cycle of 15 years, which is that of the Indictions, the origine of which is not more ancient than 13 Ages, to form the <hi>Julian</hi> period of 7980 years, of which they eſtabliſh the <hi>Epocha</hi> 4713 years before the common <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> They prefer this imaginary period, in which the errors of the <hi>Victorian</hi> period are multiplied 15 times, to the true luniſolar periods, and they do likewiſe prefer this Ideal <hi>Epocha</hi> which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe more antient than the World, to the Aſtronomical and Hiſtorical <hi>Epocha</hi>'s: even ſo far that they refer thereto the Hiſtorical Acts of the antient times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and before <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> tho the Indictions were not as yet in uſe, that there was then no Calendar to which this period could ſerve to regulate the days of the week, and that in fine the Cycle of 19 years extended to this time, demonſtrates not the ſtate of the Sun nor of the Moon; which are the three principal things for which theſe three Cycles which from the <hi>Julian</hi> period, have been invented. Wherefore it gives not ſo exact an Idea of the ancient times, which were not regulated after this manner, as of thoſe of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen laſt Ages, which were regulated amongſt us according to the <hi>Julian</hi> year.</p>
                        <p>But the luniſolar periods of 19 years, which in regard of the tropical years are ſomewhat too long, being joyned to the periods of 11 years which are too ſhort, do form other periods more preciſe than thoſe which compoſe them. Among theſe periods the firſt of the moſt preciſe are thoſe of 334, 353, and 372 years, the laſt of which is terminated alſo on the ſame day of the week; and might be placed in the ſtead of the <hi>Victorian.</hi>

                        <p>THE firſt luniſolar period compoſed of whole Ages, is that of 600 years, which is alſo compoſed of 31 periods of 19, and one of 11 years. Though the Chronologiſts ſpeak not of this period, yet it is one of the ancienteſt that have been invented.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This great year which is accompliſhed after ſix Ages, whereof not any other Author makes mention, can only be a period of luniſolar years, like to that which the <hi>Jews</hi> always uſed, and to that which the <hi>Indians</hi> do ſtill make uſe of. Wherefore we have thought neceſſary to examine what this great year muſt be, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules.</p>
                        <p>By the Rules of the I. Section it is found then, that in 600 years there are 7200 ſolar months, 7421 lunar months and 12/228. Here this little fraction muſt be neglected; becauſe that the luniſolar years do end with the lunar months, being compoſed of intire lunar months.</p>
                        <p>It is found by the Rules of the II. Section, that 7421 lunar months do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend 219146 days, 11 hours, 57 minutes, 52 ſeconds: if therefore we compoſe this period of whole days, it muſt conſiſt of 219146 days.</p>
                        <p>600 <hi>Gregorian</hi> years are alternatively of 219145 days, and 219146 days: they agree then to half a day with a luniſolar period of 600 years, calculated according to the <hi>Indian</hi> Rules.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond luniſolar period compoſed of Ages, is that of 2300 years, which being joyned to one of 600, makes a more exact period of 2900 years: And two periods of 2300 years, joyned to a period of 600 years do make a luniſolar pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of 5200 years, which is the Interval of the time which is reckoned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Chronology, from the Creation of the World to the vulgar <hi>Epocha</hi> of the years of <hi>J.

                        <p>For the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the lunar Cycles they might have taken the Equinoxial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the ſame year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> rather than the conjunction of the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> of the former year, and renew it after 616 years, which reduce the new Moons to the ſame day of the <hi>Julian</hi> year, and to the ſame day of the week: which is what they demanded of the <hi>Victorian</hi> period; but they thought only to confirm themſelves to the rule of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> which was the ſole method to reconcile the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church. Thus theſe Rules have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the paſt Age; altho it has been long perceived, that the new Moons

thus regulated, according to the Cycle of 19 years, anticipated almoſt a day in 312 <hi>Julian</hi> years, and that the Equinoxes anticipated about 3 days in 400 of theſe years.</p>

                        <p>ABout the end of the paſt Age the Anticipation of the Equinoxes ſince the <hi>Epocha</hi> choſen by the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> was mounted to 10 days: and that of the new Moons in the ſame years of the lunar Cycle continued without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption was mounted to 4 days: wherefore in ſeveral Councils there was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the manner of correcting theſe defects; and in fine, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. after having communicated his deſign to the Chriſtian Princes, and to the moſt famous Univerſities, and having underſtood their Advice, deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 10 days from the year 1582, and reduced the Equinox to the day of the year wherein it had been at the time of the <hi>Epocha,</hi> choſen by the Deputies of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He eſtabliſhed alſo a period of 400 years, ſhorter by 3 days than 400 <hi>Julian</hi> years, making common the hundred years for the reſerve of each 400, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute from the year 1600; or which amounts to the ſame thing, to reckon from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe periods of 400 <hi>Gregorian</hi> years reduce the Sun to the ſame points of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac, to the ſame days of the month, and of the week, and to the ſame hours under the ſame Meridian, the greatneſs of the year being ſuppoſed 365 days, 5 hours, 49′, 12″.</p>
                        <p>According to the modern Obſervations, in the hundred Biſſextiles the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Equinox happens the 21ſt of <hi>March,</hi> at 20 hours after noon, at the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the 96<hi rend="sup">th</hi> after the hundredth Biſſextile it happens the 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 2 hours, 43 minutes after noon, which is the Equinox that happens the ſooneſt. But the 303<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year after the hundredth Biſſextile, the middle Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox happens the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at 7 hours, 12 minutes after noon, which is the ſloweſt of all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>By theſe <hi>Epocha</hi>'s, and by his greatneſs of the year, it is eaſie perpetually to find the middle Equinoxes of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the <hi>Gregorian</hi> correction they interrupt not the ſucceſſion of the Cycles of 19 years, drawn from the ancient <hi>Alexandrian Epocha,</hi> as they might have done; but they obſerve on what day of the Moon the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year ends, at every year of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Cycle. This number of the days of the Moon at the end of a year is the <hi>Epact</hi> of the following year. 'Tis found that after the correction of the firſt year of the Cycle, the <hi>Epact</hi> is 1. Every year it is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by 11 days, but after the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year it is augmented by 12, always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting 30 when it ſurpaſſes this number, and taking the reſt for the <hi>Epact;</hi> which is done in this Age.</p>
                        <p>They obſerve alſo the Variation which the <hi>Epacts</hi> do make from Age to Age in the very years of the Ancient lunar Cycle, and they find that in 2500 <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> years they augment 8 days; which ſuppoſes the lunar month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44′, 3″, 10‴, 41″″.</p>

'Twas thought at firſt that the whole Variation of the <hi>Gregorian Epacts</hi> was included in a period of 300000 years: But this not being found conformable to the project of the correction, they were forc'd to have recourſe to ſome difficult equations, of which there is not found any determin'd period.</p>

                           <hi>XXVII.</hi> A new luniſolar and Paſchal Period.</head>
                        <p>TO ſupply this defect, and to find the <hi>Gregorian Epacts</hi> for future Ages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tables, we do make uſe of a luniſolar period of 1600 years, which has for <hi>Epocha</hi> the Equinoxial Conjunction of the year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and which reduces the new Moons ſince the correction, to the ſame day of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year, to the ſame day of the week, and almoſt to the ſame hour of the day, under the ſame Meridian. According to this period we give to each period of 400 years ſince <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 9 days of Equinoxial <hi>Epact,</hi> by deducting 29 when it ſurpaſſes this number: and we add 8 days to the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> ſince the correction, to have the Civil <hi>Gregorian Epact,</hi> by deducting 30, when the ſumm ſurpaſſes this number.</p>
                        <p>At every hundredth year, not Biſſextile, we diminiſh the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> 5 days, in reſpect of the hundredth preceding, and we take every hundreth year for <hi>Epocha</hi> of 5 periods of 19 years, to find the Augmentation of the <hi>Epacts</hi> for an Age at every year of the Cycle, after the accuſtomed manner.</p>
                        <p>Thus, to have the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> of the year 1600, which is diſtant from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> 4 periods of 400 years, multiplying 4 by 9 there is 36; from whence having deducted 29, there remains 7, the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> of the year 1600, which ſhews that the middle Equinox of the year 1600 happen'd 7 days after the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun: adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto 8 days, there are 15, which is the Civil <hi>Gregorian Epact</hi> of the year 1600,<note place="margin">Expl. Cal. p. 420.</note> as it is ſet down in the Table of the Moveable <hi>Gregorian</hi> Feaſts.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> of the year 11600, which terminates this period, muſt be 0. But to find it by the ſame method, ſince that the year 11600 is removed from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 29 periods of 400 years, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying 29 by 9, and dividing the product by 29, the quotient is 9, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder 0 for the Equinoxial period: Adding 8, there is the Civil <hi>Gregorian Epact</hi> of the year 11600, which will be 8, as <hi>Clavius</hi> had found it by the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Tables, in the 168<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page of the Explication of the Calendar; which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the conformity of the <hi>Epacts</hi> of the future Ages, found by the means of this period, after a method ſo eaſie, with the <hi>Gregorian Epacts,</hi> found by the means of three Tables of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar.</p>
                        <p>If the hours and minutes of theſe Equinoxial <hi>Epacts</hi> in the 400 years are alſo demanded, thereunto ſhall be always added 8 hours, and beſides ⅓ and 1 1/10 of as many hours as there are whole days in the <hi>Epact,</hi> and a third of as many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. Thus for the year 1600, whoſe Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> is 7 days; one third of 7 hours is 2<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 20′; a tenth is 0<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 42′; a third of 7 minutes is 2′: the ſumm added to 7 days 8 hours, makes 7 days, 11<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 4′, the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> of the year 1600.</p>
                        <p>Deducting this <hi>Epact</hi> from the time of the middle Equinox, which in 1600 happened the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> at 20 hours after noon at <hi>Rome,</hi> the middle conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction preceding will be on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at 8<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 56′: adding thereunto half a lunar month, which is 14 days, 18<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 22′, the middle oppoſition will be found on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at 3<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 18′. In the Table of the moveable Feaſts,<note place="margin">Expl. Cal. p. 420.</note> where the minutes are neglected, it is ſet down on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at 3 hours.</p>
                        <p>To have by hours and minutes the Equinoxial <hi>Epact</hi> in the hundreds, not Biſſextiles, from the <hi>Epact</hi> found in the preceding hundredth Biſſextile, ſhall be deducted 5 days, 2<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 12′, for the firſt, double for the ſecond, triple for the third (borrowing a month of 29 days, 12<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 44′, if it is required) and you will have the <hi>Epact</hi> in the hundred propoſed, which ſhall be made uſe of in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding example, comparing it with the middle Equinox of the ſame year.</p>
                        <p>By this method will be found the middle oppoſitions in the hundred years, not Biſſextile, a day before that they are ſet down,<note place="margin">Expl.

Hypotheſes</hi> require.<note place="margin">Ap. 596. ad p. 609. p. 634.</note> Which has happened alſo in the precepts, and in the examples of finding the progreſſes of the new and full Moons, and in the <hi>Epocha's</hi> of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years not Biſſextile, and in all the Calculations which are deduced thence) as is found by comparing together the new Moons calculated in the ſame Table, the Anticipation whereof, which from one common year to another muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be 10 days, 15 hours, is found ſometimes 9 days, 15 hours, as from the year 1699 to the year 1700; ſometimes 11 days, 15 hours, as from the year 1700 to 1701; and ſo likewiſe in the other hundreds not Biſſextile.</p>
                        <p>Upon this account there were ſome differences which gave occaſion carefully to examine the progreſs of the new Moon, from one <hi>Gregorian</hi> hundredth to the other;<note place="margin">Expl. Cal. p. 595.</note> and yet theſe diſputes were not capable of unfolding, at that time, the real differences that there is between ſeveral hundred Common and Biſſextile years. But as theſe Calculations of the full Moons have been made only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the <hi>Epacts,</hi> which were regulated otherwiſe, the differences fell only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der examination, which being rectified, demonſtrates the exactneſs of theſe <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian Epacts</hi> much greater, than the very Authors of the Correction ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a thing worthy of remark, that the Aſtronomical <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Calendar, are found at preſent more conformable to the Coeleſtial moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than they were ſuppoſed at the time of the correction; for as it appears by the project which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. ſent to the Chriſtian Princes, in the year 1577, he propoſed in the regulation of the years to follow the <hi>Alphonſine</hi> Tables, which were judged to be preferable to the others; but to retrench three days in 400 <hi>Julian</hi> years, he was obliged to ſuppoſe the ſolar year ſhorter by ſome ſeconds than the <hi>Alphonſine,</hi> and to prefer this conveniency to a greater exactneſs: and yet all the Aſtronomers, which have ſince compared the modern obſervations with the ancient, have found that the Tropical year is indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhorter than the <hi>Alphonſine,</hi> altho they be not agreed in the preciſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                        <p>The greatneſs of the lunar month which reſults from the <hi>Gregorian Hypotheſis</hi> of the Equation of the <hi>Epacts,</hi> which is 8 days in 2500 <hi>Julian</hi> years, is alſo more conformable to the modern Aſtronomers, than the lunar month of the <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine,</hi> and the diſpoſition of the <hi>Gregorian Epacts</hi> and the new and full Moons which reſult therefrom, are alſo oftentimes more preciſe than they which finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the correction pretended.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the whole ſyſtem of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calendar has ſome Beauties which have not been known by thoſe who were the Authors thereof, as is that of giving the <hi>Epacts</hi> conformable to thoſe which are found by the great luniſolar period, which has for <hi>Epocha</hi> the ſame year of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the very day, which according to the antient tradition, immediately precedes the day of the Incarnation; from whence may be drawn the Equinoxes and new Moons with more facility than from the <hi>Aegyptian Epocha</hi> of the Golden number, of which they would in ſome manner keep the relation.</p>
                        <p>'Twere to be wiſh'd that, ſeeing that in the project ſent to the Chriſtian Princes and to the Univerſities,<note place="margin">Expl. Cal. p. 4.</note> it was propoſed to retrench 10 or 12 days from the <hi>Julian</hi> year about the end of the paſt Age; they had retrenched 12, which is the difference between 1600 <hi>Julian</hi> years and 1600 <hi>Gregorian</hi> years, to place the Equinoxes on the ſame days of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> year as they were in the <hi>Julian</hi> year, according to the form re-eſtabliſhed by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> rather than to reſtore them to the days whereon they were at the time of the ſtrange <hi>Epocha</hi> choſen by the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> for their particular convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and that inſtead of regulating the <hi>Epacts</hi> by the defective Cycle of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> and of ſeeking Equations and Corrections for the <hi>Epacts</hi> born by this Cycle, they had alſo taken heed to the great luniſolar period of 11600 years, that we have propoſed, which immediately gives the true days of the <hi>Epacts:</hi> which reduces the new Moons to the ſame day of the year and of the week, and which has the moſt auguſt and moſt memorable <hi>Epocha</hi> amongſt the Chriſtians that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:98501:128"/>I doubt not that if from this time they had found this period which we have propoſed, they would have employ'd it not only for the Excellency of its <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> but alſo becauſe the greatneſs of the month which it ſuppoſes is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the <hi>Alphonſine</hi> Tables, as the greatneſs of the year which they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh to conform themſelves to theſe Tables, the moſt that the conveniency of the calculation did permit.</p>
                        <p>For this period is compoſed of 143472 lunar months, and of 4236813 na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural days; and conſequently it ſuppoſes the lunar month 29 days, 12<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 44′, 3″, 5‴, 28″″, 48‴″, 20‴‴; and the <hi>Alphonſine</hi> Tables do ſuppoſe it 29 days, 12<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 44′, 3″, 2‴, 58″″, 51‴″, which is ſhorter by 2‴, than that of our period.</p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> the lunar month is 29 days, 12<hi rend="sup">h</hi>, 44′, 3″, 8‴, 29″″, 46‴″, 48‴‴, which exceeds ours by three; thus this month is a mean between that of <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and that of <hi>Tycho Brahe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore this great period compoſed of a number of theſe whole months; and of a number of <hi>Gregorian</hi> periods of 400 years, and conſequently of entire weeks, and entire days, might be propoſed to ſerve as a Rule to compare all the other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods together, and to relate the times before and after the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which would be the end of the firſt of our periods, and the beginning of the ſecond; and as this great period has been invented in the exerciſes which are perform'd in the Royal Academy of Sciences, and in the Obſervatory Royal, under the Protection and by the Orders of the King; it ſeems that if the <hi>Julian</hi> period has taken its name from <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and the <hi>Gregorian</hi> from <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, this might alſo juſtly be named the luniſolar period of <hi>LO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>IS LE GRAND.</hi>

                     <p>This Problem is called Magical Squares, becauſe that <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>De Occulta Philoſophia,</hi> cap. 22. informs us that they were uſed as Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, after having engraved them on plates of diverſe metals: the cunning that there is in ranging the numbers after this manner, having appear'd ſo marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the ignorant, as to attribute the Invention thereof to Spirits ſuperior to man. <hi>Agrippa</hi> has not only given the two preceding Squares, but five ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, which are thoſe of 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81 Caſes; and he reports that theſe ſeven ſquares were conſecrated to the ſeven Planets. The Arithmeticians of theſe times have looked upon them as an Arithmetical ſport, and not as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Magic: And they have ſought out general methods to range them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt that I know who laboured therein, was <hi>Gaſpar Bachet de Meziriac,</hi> a Mathematician famous for his learned Commentaries on <hi>Diophantus.</hi> He found out an ingenious method for the unequal ſquares, that is to ſay, for thoſe that have a number of unequal caſes: but for the equal ſquares he could find none. 'Tis in a Book in <hi>Octavo,</hi> which he has entituled, <hi>Pleaſant Problems by numbers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> whom I have ſo often mentioned in my Relation, ſeeing me one day in the Ship, during our return, ſtudiouſly to range the Magical ſquares after the manner of <hi>Bachet,</hi> informed me that the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Suratte</hi> ranged them with much more facility, and taught me their method for the unequal ſquares only, having, he ſaid, forgot that of the equal.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſquare, which is that of 9 caſes, return'd to the ſquare of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> it was only ſubverted: but the other unequal ſquares were eſſentially different from thoſe of <hi>Agrippa.</hi> He ranged the numbers in the caſes immediately, and without heſitation; and I hope that it will not be unacceptable that I give the Rules, and the demonſtration of this method, which is ſurprizing for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream facility to execute a thing, which has appeared difficult to all our Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. After having divided the total ſquare into its little ſquares, they place the numbers according to their natural order, I would ſay by beginning with the unite, and continuing with 2, 3, 4, and all the other numbers ſucceſſively; and they place the unite, or the firſt number of the Arithmetical Progreſſion given, in the middle caſe of the upper tranſverſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When they have put a number into the higheſt caſe of an upright, they place the following number in the loweſt caſe of the upright, which follows
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98501:129"/>
towards the right: that is to ſay, that from the upper tranſverſe they deſcend immediately to that below.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they have placed a number in the laſt caſe of a tranſverſe, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is put in the firſt caſe of the tranſverſe immediately ſuperior, that is to ſay, that from the laſt upright, they return immediately to the firſt upright on the left.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In every other occurrence, after having placed a number, they place the following in the caſes which follow diametrically or ſlantingly from the bottom to the top, and from the left to the right, until they come to one of the caſes of the upper tranſverſe, or of the laſt upright to the right.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When they find the way ſtopp'd by any caſe already filled with any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then they take the caſe immediately under that which they have filled, and they continue it as before, diametrically from the bottom to the top, and from the left to the right.</p>
                     <p>Theſe few Rules, eaſie to retain, are ſufficient to range all the unequal ſquares in general. An example renders them more intelligible.</p>

                     <p>In this diſpoſition it is evident that the caſes of the true ſquare are alternately full, and alternately empty, and that its two Diameters are entirely full. Now the full caſes receive not any change in the ſequel of the operation, and the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters remain always ſuch as they are by poſition in the ſquare augmented: but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98501:130"/>
for the caſes of the true ſquare, which are likewiſe void, they muſt be filled with the numbers which are in the caſes of Augmentation, by tranſporting the high ones lower, and the low ones higher, each into its upright; thoſe of the right to the left, and thoſe of the left to the right, each into its tranſverſe, and all to as many caſes, as there are in the ſide of the real ſquare. Thus in the ſquare of 9 caſes, which has only three in its ſide, the unite, which is in the caſe of Augmentation at the top, is removed to the third caſe below in the ſame upright; 9, which is in the caſe of Augmentation below, is removed to the third caſe above in the ſame upright; 3, which is in the caſe of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the right, is remov'd toward the left, to the third caſe in the ſame tranſverſe; and in fine, 7, which is in the caſe of Augmentation on the left, is removed towards the right, to the third caſe in the ſame tranſverſe.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner, in the ſquare of 25 caſes, which has 5 in its ſide, the numbers, which are in the caſes of Augmentation above, do deſcend 5 caſes below each in its upright. Thoſe of the caſes of Augmentation below do aſcend five caſes above each in its upright. Thoſe of the caſes of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the right do paſs 5 caſes to the left, each in its tranſverſe: and thoſe of the caſes of Augmentation on the left do paſs 5 caſes to the right, each alſo in its tranſverſe. It ought to be the ſame in all the other ſquares proportionably, and thereby they will become all Magical.</p>

Now as by <hi>Bachet</hi>'s method every number of the caſes of Augmentation muſt be removed to as many caſes as there are in the ſide of the true ſquare, it follows that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defective rank is as far diſtant from its Complements, as there are caſes in the ſide of the true ſquare.</p>

They neither acquire, nor loſe any number in <hi>Bachet</hi>'s operation: they ſuffer only the removal of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from ſome of their caſes into others.</p>

that it ſuffices that the numbers of a <hi>Band</hi> be Arithmetically proportional to thoſe of every other <hi>Band,</hi> I will denote the firſt numbers of every <hi>Band</hi> by the letters of the Latin Alphabet, and the differences between the numbers of the ſame <hi>Band</hi> by the letters of the Greek Alphabet: and to the end that the numbers of a <hi>Band</hi> be Arithmetically proportional to the numbers of every other <hi>Band,</hi> I will ſet down

                        <p>BY <hi>Bachet</hi>'s operation it is clear, that he underſtands that the diameters are ſuch as they ought to be, by the ſole poſition of the numbers in the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſquare: and this will be always true, provided only that it is ſuppoſed, that the number of the caſe of the middle of each band, be a mean Arithmetic proportion between the other numbers of the ſame band, taken two by two: a condition, which is naturally included in the ordinary Problem of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſquares, wherein it is demanded that all the numbers be in Arithmetical proportion continued. <hi>Alternando</hi> the mean number of each bar, will be alſo a mean Arithmetic proportional between all the numbers of the ſame bar taken two by two: and hereby every mean, taken as many times as there are caſes in the band, or in the bar, which is all one, will be equal to the total ſum of the band, or of the bar. Therefore all the means of the bands, taken as many times as there are caſes in every band, or which is all one, in the ſide of the ſquare, will be equal to the total ſum of the ſquare: then taken once only, they will be equal to the ſum of one of the ranks of the Magical ſquare; and it will be the ſame of the means of the bars: and becauſe that the means of the bands do make one diameter, and the means of the bars the other, it is proved that the diameters will be exact by the ſole poſition of the numbers in the augmented ſquare, provided that every mean of a band, be a mean Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic proportional between all the numbers of its band, taken two by two.</p>
                        <p>In a word, as in the ſquares there are no augmented pairs, nor <hi>true</hi> ſquare, nor diameters of the <hi>true</hi> ſquare, becauſe that the bands of the equal ſquares have not a mean number, 'tis likewiſe a reaſon, which evinces that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, cannot be accommodated to the equal ſquares.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. IT is neceſſary to obſerve in diſpoſing theſe Letters, that after having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the capital caſe of the ſecond band, near a Letter of the firſt band, which I will call the Letter of Indication, ſo that this ſecond capital caſe be alſo the ſecond caſe of the bar which begins with this Letter of Indication, one may chuſe the capital caſe of the third band, near the Letter of the ſecond band, like to the firſt Letter of Indication, ſo that this third capital caſe be the third of the bar, wherein ſhall be the ſecond Letter of Indication. After the ſame manner ſhall be determin'd the capital caſe of every band, near the Letter of Indication of the precedent band. From whence it follows, that there are as many capital caſes as bands, and no more.</p>
                        <p>It follows alſo, that not only the Letter <hi>d</hi> is always under the Letter <hi>c</hi> in the ſame bar, but that all the other Letters are always under the ſame Letters in the ſame bars, and that the Letters have likewiſe the ſame order in all the bars, as they have the ſame in all the bands, though the orders of the Letters in the bars, is not the ſame as the order of the Letters in the bands.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:98501:132"/>1. The choice of the capital caſe of the ſecond band, which determines that of the reſt, is not entirely arbitrary. To regulate it 'tis neceſſary to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the number of the ranks of the true ſquare, which is the number 5 in the preceding example, and which is always the ſquare root of the number, which expreſſes the multitude of the caſes of the true ſquare, and ſo I will call it the root of the ſquare.</p>
                        <p>Take then a number at your own choice, provided nevertheleſs that it be leſs than the root of the ſquare, and firſt to this very root, and that by adding two points, it be ſtill firſt at the ſame root of the ſquare: 'Twill be by this number, that we ſhall determine the choice of the ſecond capital caſe: and we call it the number determining.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond capital caſe muſt not be the ſecond caſe of the ſecond band, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this ſecond caſe is found in the upright diameter of the augmented ſquare, and that there muſt not be two Letters alike in any of the diameters of the augmented ſquare: and ſo as the firſt capital caſe is already in the upright diameter, the ſecond cannot be there. It is neceſſary on the contrary, that the caſe which you ſhall chuſe in the ſecond band, for the ſecond capital, be as far diſtant from the ſecond caſe of the upright diameter, as your determining num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhall have Unites, and at the ſame time your ſecond capital ſhall be removed from the firſt capital caſe as many tranſverſes, as your determining number † 2 ſhall have Unites. Thus in the preceding example, the ſecond capital caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the caſe of the ſecond band, where is the Letter <hi>d,</hi> is the ſecond caſe after that, which is in the upright diameter, and it is in the fourth tranſverſe underneath the firſt capital caſe, which alone is looked upon as a tranſverſe, and the number 2, which determines this ſecond capital caſe, is firſt to 5, which is the root of the ſquare, and 2 † 2 that is to ſay 4, is likewiſe firſt to 5, the third caſe of the ſecond band is therefore the firſt, which removes from the upright diameter, and it is with this that it is neceſſary to begin to compute the diſtance of the reſt: ſo that the firſt caſe of this ſecond band is in this ſenſe the remoteſt of the ſecond caſe, though to reckon after a contrary ſenſe it touches it.</p>
                        <p>You may then in the preceding example, where the root of the ſquare is 5, take either 1 or 2, or 4, which do give you three different caſes, of which you may make your ſecond capital caſe, 1 is firſt to 5, and 1 will give you the caſe wherein is <hi>b,</hi> three tranſverſes diſtant from the firſt capital caſe. 2 is firſt to 5, and 2 † 2 that is to ſay 4, is alſo firſt to 5, and 2 will give you the caſe wherein is <hi>d,</hi> 4 tranſverſes diſtant from the firſt capital caſe. 3 is alſo firſt to 5, but becauſe that 3 † 2, that is to ſay 5, is not firſt to 5, 3 can give you in this example only a falſe capital caſe. 4 is firſt to 5, and 4 † 2 that is to ſay 6, is alſo firſt to 5, but from 6 it is neceſſary to deduct 5 which is the root, and there will remain 1. And 4 will give you the caſe wherein is <hi>e,</hi> the fourth in diſtance from the caſe of the diameter riſing, and has a tranſverſe near the firſt capital. The number 4 will give you then <hi>Bachet</hi>'s diſpoſition, who has placed all the capital caſes in the firſt bar: and as often as for a determining number you ſhall take a leſs number by an Unite, than the root of the ſquare, you will fall into <hi>Bachet</hi>'s diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From hence it follows, that the diameter aſcending will not have any other capital caſe than the firſt, which it has already, and that ſo it will not have twice the Letter, which ſhall be in the capital caſes. To prove it let us ſuppoſe that our bands be ſufficiently extended towards the right, to make as many new uprights as we deſire; and let us mark the firſt upright, which ſhall be as diſtant from the diameter aſcending, as the root of the ſquare has Unites: that is to ſay, which ſhall be the fifth on the right of the diameter aſcending, if the root of the ſquare is 5. And at a like diſtance from this firſt upright marked, let us mark a ſecond, and then a third, and a fourth, always at an equal diſtance one from the other, until that there are as many uprights marked, as the determining number has Unites. In this caſe as the determining number and the root of the ſquare are firſt amongſt them, the laſt upright marked will be the ſole one, whoſe diſtance to take it from the diameter aſcending, would be diviſible by the determining number.</p>
                        <p>

I ſay that in theſe ſuppoſitions, none of theſe marked uprights will have a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal caſes except the laſt: becauſe that it is the ſole marked upright, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the diameter aſcending unto it, is diviſible by the determining number: for as the uprights, wherein are the capital caſes, are as remote (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt from the upright, the ſecond from the firſt, the third from the ſecond, and ſo ſucceſſively) as the determining number has Unites, it follows that no upright has a capital caſe when the diſtance from the upright diameter unto it, is not diviſible by the determining number. 'Tis proved then that no marked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, except the laſt, will have a capital caſe: and the capital caſe which it ſhall have will be the firſt beyond the number of the caſes neceſſary to your augmented ſquare, becauſe that in counting the firſt capital caſe, there will be as many others before this, as the root of the ſquare has Unites.</p>
                        <p>Now when you mark the capital caſes in a ſquare augmented, according to the methed which I have given, ſo that when you arrive at the laſt caſe of a band, you return to its firſt caſe, as if it was after the laſt, you do no other thing, than ſucceſſively to place all the capital caſes, in reſpect of the diameter aſcending, as in the caſe of the extenſion of the bands, you will place one after the other in regard of all the uprights ſucceſſively marked. And none of your capital caſes, except a firſt ſupernumerary, can fall into your aſcending diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as no other, except a firſt ſupernumerary, could fall into your laſt upright marked.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But if you conſider the firſt capital caſe, as a tranſverſe, and that you make the ſame ſuppoſitions as before, ſo that there are as many tranſverſes marked, as the determining number † 2 ſhall have Unites, and as diſtant (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt from the firſt capital caſe, the ſecond from the firſt, the third from the ſecond, and ſo ſucceſſively) as the root of the ſquare ſhall have Unites: From this that the root of the ſquare and the determining number † 2 are firſt amongſt them, and from this that the determining number † 2 expreſſes the diſtance of the tranſverſes, wherein will be the capital caſes, you will prove that there ſhall be only the laſt tranſverſe marked, which has a capital caſe, which will be the firſt ſupernumerary: and conſequently, that the defective rank, the firſt capital caſe of which is the complement, will have no capital caſe, becauſe that it is the firſt tranſverſe marked: and you will prove alſo that the firſt ſupernumerary capital caſe muſt return to the tranſverſe of the firſt capital caſe, and as it muſt return likewiſe to the upright diameter, it follows that the firſt ſupernumerary caſe, that is to ſay, that which you would mark after the laſt of the neceſſary, is the firſt capital caſe, becauſe there is only this which is common to its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and to the upright diameter.</p>

                        <p>THis ſuppoſed, the demonſtration of the Problem is eaſie, for whereas no letter is twice in any of the diameters of the augmented ſquare, nor in any defective rank and its complement, it follows that every of the two dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters, and every defective rank and its complement have all the letters, and that conſequently they make the ſame ſumm.</p>

                        <head>Of the Diameters.</head>
                        <p>THe Band which makes one of the diameters being Magical by poſition, as it ought to be, continues Magical, becauſe that it receives not any new Letter, nor loſes any of its own. The bar which makes the other diameter is found Magical by the diſpoſition, and the proof is this.</p>
                        <p>As far as the bar of the ſecond capital caſe is removed from the firſt bar, ſo much the bar of the third capital caſe, is removed from the bar of the ſecond, and ſo ſucceſſively, the firſt bars to which you return, being reckon'd in this caſe as coming after the laſt. Now the bar of the ſecond capital caſe is as far diſtant from the firſt as there are Unites in the determining number † 1. Therefore if the determining number † 1 is firſt to the root of the ſquare, the preceding demonſtration ſufficeth to prove, that not any bar will have two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alike, wherefore the bar which ſhall ſerve as the diameter, will not have two Letters alike, and ſo it will have all the Letters once.</p>
                        <p>But if the determining number †1 is an <hi>aliquot</hi> part of the root of the ſquare, then each bar will have as many Letters alike, as there ſhall be Unites in the determining number † 1, and there will be as many different Letters, as there ſhall be Unites in the other <hi>aliquot</hi> part of the root of the ſquare, which ſhall be the quotient of the diviſion made from the root by the determining number † 1. Theſe ſeveral Letters will be therefore in an odd number, becauſe that this quotient can be only an odd number, being an <hi>aliquot</hi> of an odd number Of theſe Letters in an odd number, the one will be the middle of the firſt band, the others, taken two by two, will be like to the Letters of the firſt band, which taken alſo two by two, will be equally remote from the middle, the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the head of the band, the other towards the tail: So that if the order of the Letters of the firſt band, is as the middle by its ſituation, or middle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional between all the others, which, taken two by two, ſhall be equally remote from it, then the bar which ſhall ſerve as diameter will be Magical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if it has not the middle Letters of all the bands, it will have the power thereof; for the other Letters, which ſhall not be mean, if being taken two by two, the one is weaker than the middle of its band, the other will be ſtronger as much as the middle of its own; and thus the two together will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the middle of their bands. As for example, in the ſquare of 81 caſes, the root of which is 9, if the determining number is 2, as 2 † 1, that is to ſay, 3 is the <hi>aliquot</hi> part of 9, the correſponding <hi>aliquot</hi> of which, that is to ſay that, which returns from the diviſion of 9 by 3, is alſo 3, there will be in each bar three ſeveral Letters which will every one be there repeated three times. The firſt of the different will be the middle of the firſt band, the two others between the different, will be alike to two of the firſt band equally diſtant from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. After the ſame manner in the ſquare of 225 caſes, the root of which is 15, if the determining number is likewiſe 2, as 2 † 1, that is to ſay, 3 is the <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot</hi> part of 15 (of which 5 is the <hi>aliquot</hi> correſponding) it will happen that in every bar there will be 5 ſeveral Letters repeated every one three times. The one will be the middle of the firſt band, the 4 others will be alike to 4 of the firſt band, which taken two by two will be equidiſtant from the middle.</p>
                        <p>The Concluſion is then, that when the determining number † 1, is firſt to the root of the ſquare, the bar which ſerves as diameter can only be Magical: but that if the determining number † 1, is <hi>aliquot</hi> of the root of the ſquare, the bar which ſerves as diameter cannot be Magical; that the middle Letter of the firſt band, cannot be the middle Arithmetic of all the other Letters of its firſt band two by two, and that it is not the Letters of its band, which, taken two by two, are at equal diſtances from it, and the like of which ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the bar, which ſhall ſerve as diameter. After this the order of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the firſt band is arbitrary.</p>
                        <p>In a word, the neareſt of theſe equidiſtant Letters, ſhall be each as diſtant from the middle, as the determining number † 1 ſhall have Unites, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98501:134"/>
ſhall be as remote from theſe firſt, every one from its own, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid that it is neceſſary to take the ſecond capital caſe in the ſecond band, tho it may be taken in ſuch other band as one pleaſes, provided that the band of the third capital caſe be as diſtant from the band of the ſecond caſe, as this ſhall be from the firſt, and that the band of the fourth capital caſe be at this very diſtance from the band of the third, and ſo ſucceſſively, the firſt bands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in order after the laſt. But beſides this, it is neceſſary that this diſtance be expreſſed by a number firſt to the root of the ſquare, and the thing will return to the ſame, that is to ſay, to put a capital caſe in each band. But if you put the ſecond capital caſe in a band, whoſe diſtance from the firſt band, was not expreſſed by a number firſt to the root of the ſquare, then ſeveral capital caſes would fall in the firſt band, which being ſuppoſed full of all the different Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, could not receive the like Letters, which fill the capital caſes.</p>

                        <head>Another way of varying the Magical Squares.</head>
                        <p>YOU ſhall double the preceding variations, if you perform in the bars what you did in the bands, and in the bands what you performed in the bars; taking for one of the diameters, a bar which ſhould be Magical by poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rendring Magical by diſpoſition the band which ſhall be the other diameter.</p>
                        <p>From theſe Principles it follows, that the ſquare of 9 caſes is always the ſame, without being able to receive eſſential varieties, becauſe that it can have only two for the determining number: and becauſe that the removing of the bands, or of the bars amongſt them, makes only a ſimple ſubverſion, by reaſon that there are only two bands and two bars ſubject to tranſpoſition, and that the band and the bar which ſerve as diameters cannot be diſplaced.</p>
                        <p>It follows alſo, that always one of the diameters at leaſt muſt be Magical by poſition: and that the greateſt and leaſt of the number propoſed to fill a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſquare, can never be at the center, becauſe that the center is always filled by one of the numbers of the diameter by poſition, in which, be it band or bar, the greateſt nor ſmalleſt number cannot be.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, the middle number of the whole ſquare, that is to ſay, that which by the poſition is at the center of the augmented ſquare, will remain at the center of the Magical ſquare, as often as the diameter by poſition ſhall have the capital caſe at one of its ends, but in every other caſe it will go out thence, and yet it will never depart from the diameter by poſition.</p>
                        <p>All which things muſt be underſtood according to the ſuppoſitions above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. Beſides I know that the uneven Magical ſquares may be varied into a ſurprizing number of ways, unto which all that I have ſaid would not agree.</p>

In conſidering this ſquare, I ſee that the two diameters, and the middle upright and tranſverſe means do make the ſame ſumm: which Mr. <hi>de Malezieu</hi> thought to have given ground to the Problem, out of a deſire of rendering the other tranſverſes and other uprights equal alſo, without deſtroying the equality of Diagonals.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I ſee that the firſt tranſverſe contains all the numbers, from the unite to the root of the ſquare: that the ſecond tranſverſe contains theſe ſame numbers and in the ſame order, but augmented every one with a root: that the third contains alſo theſe very numbers in the ſame order, augmented every one with two roots: that it is the ſame in every tranſverſe, ſave that the fourth has every one of theſe numbers augmented with three roots, that the fifth hath them augmented with four roots, and ſo in proportion of the other tranſverſes, if there were more.</p>

And becauſe that theſe very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do bear every one the ſame number of roots in the ſame tranſverſe, I ſhall alſo render the tranſverſes equal, if I make that every tranſverſe have not all theſe ſeveral numbers of it ſelf, but that it borrows one of every tranſverſe. Thus the diameters are already equal, becauſe that they have every one the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral numbers that it is neceſſary to have, and that they take one from every tranſverſe, that is to ſay, one without the root, the other augmented with a root, the other with 2, the other with 3, and ſo ſucceſſively.</p>
                        <p>The true ſecret then is to diſpoſe all the numbers of every tranſverſe in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrical way, that is to ſay ſlanting, ſo that having placed one number, the following will be in another tranſverſe and another upright at the ſame time. Which cannot be better performed than after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner.</p>

                        <p>It is clear that in this diſpoſition not any tranſverſe, nor any upright have two numbers, neither from the ſame tranſverſe, nor from the ſame upright of the natural ſquare, and that the diameter which we have not made by poſition, has alſo only one number from every tranſverſe, and every upright of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſquare. This is what M. <hi>de Malezieu</hi> thought, without having had the leiſure to fathom it further; and it is evidently the Principle, on which the <hi>Indian</hi> Method and that of <hi>Bachet</hi> are grounded, and all the others, of which I have ſhown, that it is poſſible to vary the Magical ſquares. And if care be taken that in a Magical ſquare the ranks parallel to the diameters are defective, and that they have their complements, it will be ſeen that <hi>Bachet</hi>'s augmented ſquare, and the Magical ſquare have oppoſite proprieties. In the augmented ſquare, the bands which are the true ranks, are not Magical, and its defective ranks aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with their complements are. On the contrary, in the Magical ſquare the ranks are Magical, and the defective ranks and their complements do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, every one, what a band of the augmented ſquare contains.</p>
                        <p>To finiſh what M. <hi>de Malezieu</hi> has thought, it is neceſſary only to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date what we have ſaid concerning the choice of the capital caſes: and becauſe that this is eaſie to do, I will ſpeak no more of it.</p>
                        <p>M. <hi>de Malezieu</hi> thought likewiſe, that this principle might ſerve to the even ſquares, and this is true: but here likewiſe there is found difficulty in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, becauſe that in the even ſquares, the defective ranks and their comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have every one a caſe in the ſame diameter, or have none at all, ſo that by diſperſing the numbers from a tranſverſe into a defective rank, and its comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, two numbers of this tranſverſe are put into the ſame diameter, or elſe none at all, and the one and the other of theſe two things is equally bad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there is no tranſverſe in the even ſquares, which can furniſh a diameter by poſition: and ſo it would be neceſſary to remove a little into the even ſquares, after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner of diſpencing the numbers, and to put one into each rank and one into each diameter. But the Method preſents not it ſelf immediately. However here is the firſt example thereof.</p>

                        <p>I Thought to have divined it from the examples of the ſquares of 16, 36, and 64 caſes, which <hi>Agrippa</hi> has given us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As the ranks are in even number in the even ſquares, they may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two by two. Comparing then the firſt to the laſt, the ſecond to the laſt ſave one, the third to the laſt but two, and ſo ſucceſſively, by equally removing us from the firſt and the laſt ranks, we will call them oppoſite, be they tranſverſe, or upright.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe that the numbers of one rank, are arithmetically proportional with thoſe of another rank of the ſame way, it is clear to thoſe who underſtand arithmetical proportion, that two oppoſite ranks do make the ſame total ſum as two other oppoſite ranks, and that if this ſum be divided into two equals, each half will be the ſum that a Magical rank ought to make.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The oppoſite numbers are alſo the firſt and laſt of the whole ſquare, the ſecond and laſt ſave one, the third and laſt but two, and ſo ſucceſſively, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving as equally from the firſt and laſt numbers: ſo that the ſum of two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite numbers is always equal to the ſum of other oppoſites.</p>
                        <p>From hence it is evident, that the numbers oppoſite to thoſe of one rank, are the numbers which are in the oppoſite rank, and that to render the ſums of two oppoſite ranks equal, it is neceſſary only to take the moity of the numbers of one of the ranks, and to exchange them for their oppoſites, which are in the other.

To render them equal, it is neceſſary only to take 2 and 3, which are the moity of the numbers of the firſt, and to exchange them for 14 and 15, their oppoſites; and ſo 1, 14, 15, 4, will make the ſame ſum as 13, 2, 3, 16.</p>
                        <p>The tranſverſes between them, and the uprights between them, may render themſelves equal by this Method: but becauſe that the choice of the oppoſite numbers may be made after ſeveral ways, the <hi>Indians</hi> have choſen one, that is eaſie to retain, which leaves the diameters ſuch as they are in the natural ſquare, becauſe that they are ſuch as they ought to be, and ranges the uprights, when it is intended only to range the tranſverſes. The whole Method conſiſts then in knowing how to range two oppoſite tranſverſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rules are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They take the half of the numbers of the upper tranſverſe, and remove them to the lower: and they take their oppoſite numbers in the lower tranſverſe, and remove them to the upper.</p>

The firſt and the laſt uprights of the ſquares unequally even do rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one in relation to the other, as the firſt and the laſt tranſverſes: and by this means the whole ſquare unequally even is found Magical, and by a Method eaſie to retain, and to execute by Memory.</p>
                        <p>The demonſtration thereof is palpable. For to conſider the numbers, as we have ranked them in the firſt and laſt tranſverſes; it is evident that the oppoſite numbers, taken two by two, are there placed either diametrically in the firſt and laſt caſes of every tranſverſe, or directly oppoſite in the ſame upright, and becauſe that the oppoſite numbers taken, thus two by two, do always make equal ſums, it follows that theſe two tranſverſes being at the top and at the bottom of the ſquares equally even, and interior already Magical, will add equal ſums to the diameters, and to the uprights of this interior ſquare equally even; and that ſo the uprights and diameters of the ſquare unequally, will be equal in their ſums. It will be the ſame of the tranſverſes of the ſquare unequally even, becauſe that its firſt and its laſt uprights will likewiſe add equal ſums to the tranſverſes of the interior ſquare equally even. And our demonſtration would be compleat, were not the two numbers mean as well of the firſt, and laſt tranſverſes, as of the firſt and laſt uprights: for theſe numbers not being placed every right againſt its oppoſite, do add unequal ſums to the middle tranſverſes and uprights of the interior ſquare equally even. Therefore to repair this ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, which is only of two points, it is neceſſary to make a little alteration in the interior ſquare equally even, which will be the laſt rule of this Method.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. By ranging the interior ſquare equally even, according to the rules of the Magical ſquares equally even; it is neceſſary to invert the order, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe rules of the ſquares equally even, the two middle numbers of the laſt tranſverſe of the ſquare of 16 caſes, which is at the center of all, and the two middle numbers of the laſt upright of the ſame ſquare of ſixteen caſes, ought to have, you will thus weaken the firſt middle upright, and the firſt middle tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the ſquare equally even: foraſmuch as in the firſt tranſverſe of the ſquare of 16 caſes, the firſt middle number is always ſtronger than the ſecond, and that in the laſt upright of the ſame ſquare of 16 caſes, the middle ſuperior number is ſtronger than the inferior.</p>

Thus 14 and 20, which are the middle of the laſt upright of the ſame ſquare of 16 caſes, are in a contrary number, to that which they ought to have by the ſame rules: for it would be neceſſary that 10 was before 9, and 14 under 20.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="247" facs="tcp:98501:138"/>In the ſquare of 100 caſes at the ſeventh tranſverſe, the middle numbers 35 and 36 are placed againſt the very rules of the ſquares equally even: 36 ought to precede 35 according to the rules: and 44 and 54 which are the middle of the ſeventh upright are alſo inverted, becauſe that 44 ought to be under 54.</p>
                        <p>In every ſquare equally even ranged Magically, according to the rules which I have given, it is infallible that in the tranſverſe, which is immediately under the middle tranſverſes, the two middle numbers ſhould be in an inverted order, that is to ſay, the ſtrongeſt precedes the weakeſt: for either theſe middle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are removed, and conſequently in an inverted order, or they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and they are likewiſe in an inverted order, becauſe that then their tranſverſe begins at the right: foraſmuch as if the middle numbers of each rank are not removed as it is ſuppoſed, the middle of the firſt upright are not, and ſo the middle tranſverſes begin on the left, therefore the tranſverſe underneath begins on the right. By a like ratiocination it will be proved, that according to the rules of the ſquares equally even, the middle numbers of the upright, which is immediately after the middle uprights, are ranged in ſuch a manner, that the ſtrongeſt is always above the weakeſt.</p>
                        <p>This is <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Method of the even ſquares, which in my opinion are the <hi>Indian,</hi> the merit of which conſiſts not in giving the ſole poſſible manner of ranging the even ſquares, but the moſt eaſie to execute by memory: For it is to this principally that it ſeems, that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould addict themſelves. In a word, the <hi>Indian</hi> even ſquares are alſo Magical in the Geometrical Progreſſion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> have two Principles for the Problem of the Magical ſquares, the one of which they have applied to the uneven ſquares, and the other to the even. The Mathematicians of this Country, which have laboured herein, have known only one of theſe two Principles, which is that of the even ſquares; but they have adapted it likewiſe to the uneven ſquares, and moreover they have added a ſingular condition to this Problem, which is that the Magical ſquare be ſo ranged, that in deducting its firſt compaſs, that is to ſay its firſt and its laſt tranſverſes, its firſt and its laſt uprights, the interior ſquare which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main is found Magical, after this very kind, that is to ſay, being able to loſe all its compaſſes one after the other, and to leave always for the reſt a Magical ſquare, provided that this reſidue have at leaſt 9, or 16 caſes; becauſe that the ſquare of 4 caſes cannot be Magical.</p>
                        <p>Monſieur <hi>Arnoud</hi> has given the ſolution of this laſt Problem at the end of his Elements of Geometry, and before that he had printed it the firſt time, I had alſo reſolved this Problem in its whole extent, having been propoſed to me by the late Monſieur <hi>de Fermat,</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> whoſe Memory is yet in Veneration amongſt the learned: but then I divined not <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Principle of the unequal ſquares, nor the reaſon of <hi>Bachet</hi>'s Method.</p>
                        <p>In fine, I am obliged to render this Teſtimony to Monſieur <hi>Sauveur,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Mathematics at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he found out a Demonſtration of the <hi>Indian</hi> uneven ſquares, which Monſieur <hi>de Melezieu</hi> communicated unto him: and that he has alſo invented a Method to range the even ſquares. I leave unto him the care of publiſhing this, and ſeveral other things of his own Invention, becauſe that this Chapter is already too long.</p>

                     <head>The Care of the Manners amongſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and of the Antiquities of their Hiſtory.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CHina</hi> is happily ſituated, having no foreign war to fear. It has no other Neighbours then <hi>Tartary</hi> on the North, and <hi>Tonguin</hi> on the Weſt. Every where elſe it is bounded either by the Ocean, or with a deſart of ſeveral days Journey, or with Woods, and Mountains almoſt impaſſable. <hi>Tonquin</hi> is a very little ſtate, if compar'd to <hi>China:</hi> and it is ſeated under thoſe hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, from whence it never comes out as Conqueror. The <hi>Tartar</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98501:139"/>
accuſtomed only to make incurſions on his Enemies, and not wars in form. A wall on the frontiers of <hi>China,</hi> which ſtops the paſſages, has ſufficed during a long ſucceſſion of Ages, to ſtop all the Enterprizes of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is no wonder then if the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are little addicted to War, and if the <hi>Tartars,</hi> tho more weak, and otherwiſe leſs proper to make Conqueſts, have yet ſubdued them twice in the ſpace of three or four thouſand years.</p>
                     <p>But as much as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have ignored war, as much are they experienc'd in the knowledge of Government. Their good natural wit has made them to improve it with ſo much care in the repoſe which their Country has almoſt continually enjoyed, that next to the Laws which God gave unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> there are none perhaps which do make a compleater body of Policy, nor whoſe parts concur better to the ſame end, than the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Laws. Thus this people is the moſt numerous that has ever been in the World, except perhaps the people of God: which, in my opinion, is the beſt ſign of an happy Government.</p>
                     <p>I have ſufficiently declared in my relation, how the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have ſuited their Religion to their Policy, by making of the ſpirit of Heaven, and of the other ſpirits an inviſible Republick like to theirs, of which they ſuppoſe that the members have a ſecret correſpondence with the members of theirs, and that they puniſh the hidden faults of their Kings, of their Magiſtrates, and of every one of their Citizens in particular.</p>
                     <p>I have obſerved likewiſe how they have provided for the Perpetuity of their Laws, by the dread of their dead Parents, whom they ſuppoſe to be provoked in the other life, with the faults which their Children commit in this, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the great want of reſpect which it would be in the <hi>Chineſes</hi> towards their Anceſtors, to change the Laws which they have left them. 'Tis not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a vain Ceremony that they mourn for three years with an extream Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſeparated from all public Employment, which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Laws do order Children to obſerve at the death of their Father and Mother, and from which they diſpence not even their Kings. They cannot too much imprint in their minds this reſpect, which has always been their greateſt ſupport.</p>
                     <p>But what I moſt admire in the Laws of <hi>China,</hi> is the care which they have taken to form the Morals, ſeeing that it is only good manners, which can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Laws, as it is only good Laws that can make good manners. <hi>Plato,</hi> methinks, underſtood the whole importance of this Maxim, and if my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fails me not, he requires in ſome places of his Laws, that they intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the privacy of the Oeconomy of his Citizens: and becauſe he feared that this might appear too new to the People, ſo free as the <hi>Greeks</hi> were in his time, he ſought ſome excuſe for the little which he delivered thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chineſes,</hi> on the contrary, have not ſcrupled to give Laws to almoſt all the Actions of men. One of their moſt ancient Books regulates not only the Rites, which concern Religion and the Sacrifices, but all the Duties of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Father, and of the Father towards his Children; of the Husband to the Wife, and of the Wife to the Husband; of Brethren and Friends to each other; of the King to his Subjects, and of the Subjects to their King; of the Magiſtrates to the People, and of the People to the Magiſtrates. In this Book, which has the Authority of a Law, the old men are conſidered as the Fathers of all the People, and of the King himſelf, the Orphans are there conſidered as his Children, and all the Citizens as Brethren amongſt them. Father <hi>Martinius</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Hiſt. ſin. p. 352.</note> that there is almoſt no humane action, how ſmall ſoever it be, to which this Book preſcribes not Laws, even to cauſe trouble for an exceeding ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I doubt not that all the <hi>Europeans</hi> would judge like him, if this Book came to our knowledge, but this is nevertheleſs a very ancient Teſtimony, of the extream care which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have continually taken of good manners.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe they knew the prevalency which the example of Kings has over People, their greateſt ſtudy has always been to inſpire Vertue into their Kings. <hi>The People,</hi> they ſay, <hi>is like the Ears of Corn wherewith a field is covered, the Morals of the Prince are like the Wind, which inclines them, where it liſteth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Policy has therefore no particuluar manners for their Kings, and other manners for the People. Their Kings are obliged to reſpect old men: they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98501:139"/>
nouriſh them in every City; and the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory honourably mentions ſuch of their Kings, which have rendered them moſt reſpect, and ſome others, who have cauſed their illegitimate Brethren, which precede them in Age, to ſit down at their Table, and above them. Their Kings are obliged to the three years mourning upon the death of their Father and their Mother, and to abſtain during this time from the cares of the Government, altho perhaps this Law has loſt it Vigour in the laſt times. When <hi>China</hi> was as yet divided into little States, which were as ſo many Fiefs of this great Empire, <hi>Ven-cum</hi> King of <hi>Cin</hi> chaſed out of his little Kingdom by his Step-mother, would not undertake a war to re-enter, till he had mourn'd for his Father three years.</p>
                     <p>They believe amongſt other things, that their dead Parents can ſhorten or prolong the life of their Children; they deſire of them a long and happy life, and upon this ridiculous ground, they have in the ſame terms with us, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which we have from God himſelf, and of which his eternal verity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecter unto us: <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother that thou mayeſt enjoy a long life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Xin</hi> the firſt King of the Race <hi>Cina,</hi> having baniſhed his Mother for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence, and becauſe that his Adulterer made uſe of the favour of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to revolt, and to aſſemble a great Army, was conſtrained by all his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to recall her from exile, altho he had made himſelf King by force, and that thereby he ſeemed to be ſtronger than the Laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hoei</hi> the ſecond King of the Race <hi>Hana,</hi> having alſo an unchaſt Mother, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to puniſh her: but not being willing to reign and ſuffer her debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he abandon'd the Government to her out of an extream Piety, and plunged himſelf into debauchery: ſo that <hi>Hiaovu</hi> the ſixth King of the ſame Race, put the Queen his wife to death, for fear of leaving behind him a debauched Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and a Mother incommodious to his Succeſſor.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not end if I would relate all the examples of the extream reſpect which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have for their Father, and for their Mother: I will add only that they change not their Officers, as they innovate nothing in their Laws.</p>
                     <p>They are inſtructed alſo not to have leſs reſpect for their Governors, than particular perſons have for their maſters. Their Governor they call <hi>Colao,</hi> whom they generally make their chief Miniſter, as the Grand Segnior calls his Grand Vizier <hi>Lala,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Governor.</hi> This reſpect is ſo entire amongſt them, that they chaſtiſe, as I have ſaid, in ſome place of my Relation, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Prince the preſumptive Heir of the Crown, for the faults which that Prince commits, and that there are found ſome Princes, who being become Kings have revenged their Governors.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the <hi>Colao,</hi> who is the King's principal Council, he has other Officers, whoſe ſole Function is to reprehend him publicly for his Faults. <hi>Yvus</hi> the firſt King of the race <hi>Hiaa,</hi> who according to their Hiſtory began to reign 2207 years before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> gave full liberty to all good perſons to give him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: and yet becauſe that he found himſelf once reproved with too much ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the preſence of his principal Councellors, he was ſo vexed thereat, that he had reſolved to put him to death who had given him this affront: but his Wife appeaſed him. Being adorned more than ordinary, ſhe preſented her ſelf before him: and as he was ſmitten with this dreſs, which in the perplexity wherein he was, ſeemed to him improper, ſhe told him, that ſhe came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him, for having in his Court ſuch couragious and faithful Servants, as dare to tell him the truth. This liberty of admoniſhing the Prince, paſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into a Law: There were, as I have ſaid, ſome Offices purpoſely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the exerciſing it; yet without taking it away from any other Officer of State: and the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have always been ſo jealous of this Prerogative, that ſeveral have died to maintain it, and that there have been ſome examples, even in this Age, that when the King was obſtinate not to hear any important reproof, the Officers of the Court, to the number ſometimes of two Thouſand, have entered into his Palace, there to lay down the Badges of their Offices. So that it is impoſſible that a King of <hi>China</hi> can continue King, if he is vicious to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree. Thus, ſome tell him inceſſantly, that it is his example, which muſt render the Magiſtrates, and the People virtuous; and that if he departs
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98501:140"/>
from the Vertue of his Anceſtors, the Magiſtrates and People growing debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Morals, would forget their fidelity which they owe him, and which is their firſt duty, and their firſt Vertue. Examples hereof are frequent in their Hiſtory: in which they have not better provided for the ſecurity of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, than all the other Deſpotic States. According to them it is 4000 years that their Kingdom has continued in theſe Maxims, which render it the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all its Neighbors. S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                        <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> reports in his Letters that the <hi>Jap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſes</hi> inceſſantly objected to him, that the Chriſtian Religion could not be true, ſeeing that it was not known by the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> Yet I know that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have ſome Vices, but they perhaps ſin leſs againſt their Moral Law, than we do againſt ours. How much have our Morals degenerated from thoſe of our Anceſtors? and the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> more antient than us, do ſtill eſteem it a diſgrace to violate their Morals in public, and to fail in the reſpects which they owe to one another, either by any diſobedience to their Parents, or by any quarrel with their equals. They are Infidels, ſay ſome, in Commerce; but it may be they are only ſo with Strangers; as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> lent money to uſury to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers only: and beſides, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> which have Commerce with Strangers, are thoſe of the Frontiers, whoſe manners this very foreign Commerce has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Vice of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> is doubtleſs an extream Hypocriſy: but beſides that it reigns every where, becauſe it is a Vice which is free from the cenſure of the Laws, it is perhaps a leſs evil, than a publick corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory may be credited, 'tis Vertue alone that has formed this great Empire: the love of their Laws, which were at firſt eſtabliſhed in a corner of this Country, gradually drew all the Neighbouring Provinces under the ſame yoke, it not appearing that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have conquered theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by any war. It is true that all theſe little States, which were at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as ſo many hereditary Fiefs given uſually to the Princes of the Royal Blood, have been reunited to the Crown by Civil Wars, when the Royal race has chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Uſurpers have expelled the lawful Kings from the Throne; but it appears that the firſt ſubjection of all theſe little States to the Crown of <hi>China</hi> has been voluntary. They ſay that 44 Kingdoms, enamoured with the Vertue of <hi>Venvam,</hi> ſubmitted to his Laws. He reigned over the two thirds of <hi>China,</hi> when it was yet divided. However it be, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have been continually Enemies to war, as the principal cauſe of the corruption of manners, and they have preferred Morality before all the Glory of Conqueſts, and all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Commerce with Strangers.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Siven,</hi> the ninth of the Race <hi>Hana,</hi> 60 years before the birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> dreading the conſequences of any motion of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which ſometime before had been confined within their Mountains by <hi>Hiaovu,</hi> and who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to ſeize on the flat Country, reſolved to prevent them, and make war upon them, before they had put themſelves in a condition to carry it into <hi>China.</hi> In another Country this Prudence might have been approved, but it was not at <hi>China,</hi> where the care of good manners is the main affair of the State. The Hiſtory therefore relates, that his Chief Miniſter diſſwaded him from this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize by this diſcourſe. <hi>What, Sir, do you think to invade foreign Countrys, when there are ſuch great things to reform in your own. A Prodigy to this hour unheard of amongſt us! in this year a Son has ſlain his Father, ſeven younger Brothers have killed their</hi> 25 <hi>elder Brethren. Theſe are the ſigns of an intolerable boldneſs, and which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage a very dangerous corruption in our manners. 'Tis what we ought to be alarumed at; it is to what a ſpeedy remedy muſt be applied; for ſo long as theſe Crimes ſhall not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at</hi> China, China <hi>will have nothing to fear from the</hi> Tartars: <hi>but if they were once permitted, I fear that they would not only extend themſelves into all the Territories of the Empire, but even into the Imperial Palace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Under <hi>Juen,</hi> the Tenth King of the ſame race, the Provinces of <hi>Qnantong,</hi> and <hi>Quangſi,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Hainan</hi> revolting, he levied as many forces as it was poſſible to reduce them to their Obedience: but <hi>Kiaſu,</hi> whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their General diverted him from this war, by theſe words. <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98501:140"/>
the Kingdom of</hi> China, <hi>was bounded on the Eaſt by the Ocean, on the Weſt by the Sandy Deſart, and on the South by the River</hi> Kiang: <hi>but by little and little it enlarged its limits leſs by Arms, than by Vertue. Our Kings do kindly receive under their Empire, thoſe who voluntarily ſubmit themſelves out of Love to our Juſtice and Clemency, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neighbouring Provinces ſubmitted thereunto: not any was compelled by force. 'Tis my advice that you abſtain from this war, and that imitating the good Kings which have lived before you, you may make them to revive in your Maxims. The way to reduce a rebelious People to Obedience, is by the allurement of Vertue, and not by the horror of Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>China</hi> has had ſome conquering Kings, but two or three at moſt, if I am not miſtaken: though they ſay, that <hi>Hiaovu,</hi> who was one of theſe, repented of the wars which he had made, and took no care to preſerve his Conqueſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gu-Cupn</hi> one of the Diſciples of <hi>Confucius,</hi> asked him one day what things were neceſſary to a good Government, <hi>Plenty of Proviſions,</hi> replied he, <hi>a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Souldiers and Ammunition for War, of Virtue in the King and his Subjects. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what you tell me,</hi> replied the Diſciple, <hi>but if it were neceſſary to lack one of theſe three things, which will you quit the firſt? The Souldiers,</hi> anſwered the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. <hi>But if there was a neceſſity alſo of lacking Proviſions or Vertue, which of theſe two loſſes would you chuſe? I would chuſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to want Proviſions.</hi> He could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtifie the Contempt of War, and the Love of good Morals. <hi>Plato</hi> would have but a ſmall number of Citizens in his Republic, becauſe that he dreaded the corruption in too great a Multitude, and that he cared not ſo much as his Republic ſhould laſt, as that it ſhould be happy, and conſequently virtuous, ſo long as it did laſt.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have never neglected the inſtruction of the People. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is eaſie to know the Laws which are public, and which never alter, they publiſh every fifteen days, by Proclamation a ſmall number of Precepts, which are the ground of their Moral Law, as the Commandments of God are ours.</p>
                     <p>They have not neglected Puniſhments, ſeeing that the Magiſtrates do anſwer for the faults of their Family, the Parents for the faults of their Children, the Superiors for the crimes of their Inferiors, and that they all have a right to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the faults of thoſe, for whom they anſwer: but I have already handled theſe things, and ſome others in my Relation,</p>
                     <p>This is what I had to ſay, concerning the care which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have had to to preſerve their Morals, the duration of which is doubtleſs the greateſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we have ſeen among men. It may be ſuſpected, that their Hiſtory is flattering in ſome things. They can lye, without fearing to be contradicted by their Neighbors: and it is probable that they have not always ſpoken the Truth, ſeeing that their Hiſtory is the work of their policy. The Office of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian is amongſt them a public Office. The Hiſtory of a King is written after his death, by the order of his Succeſſor, who ſometimes has been his Enemy; and not any Hiſtory is publiſhed, till the Race of the Kings whereof it treats, is extinct, or at leaſt driven from the Throne. It is not lawful for any Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, to call in queſtion the Hiſtory already written, nor for any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to write Hiſtory: every one only may make Abridgments of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries already publiſhed. There is therefore but one ſingle general Hiſtory, and no particular Memoirs. Yet there is no appearance that they have corrupted the moſt important of the Events; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians cannot perhaps have been more faithful in what they have writ to the Honor of their Country, and to the Shame of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>But a particular reaſon caſts a great doubt on the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory, from the beginning of their Monarchy to about 200 years before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Xin</hi> the firſt King of the Race <hi>Cina,</hi> who reigned about 200 years before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> burnt as far as it was poſſible, all the Books of <hi>China,</hi> which treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of Medicine or Divination. Their Hiſtory ſhows that he exerciſed great cruelties, againſt thoſe which concealed Books, and that ſo few eſcaped his fury, and almoſt none entirely: A very ſingular event amongſt thoſe who continually deſtroy the Memorial of things paſt. This therefore ſufficeth in my opinion to doubt, if one will, whether this great Empire could be formed without any war.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:98501:141"/>Notwithſtanding this loſs of their Books, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> ceaſe not to give a compleat Hiſtory not only from the beginning of their Monarchy, but from the Origine of Mankind, which they make to re-aſcend ſeveral thouſands of years beyond the Truth. Nevertheleſs they themſelves acknowledge that their Hiſtory has the ſemblance of a Fable in whatever precedes the beginning of their Monarchy; but it has been hitherto difficult to perſwade them that they had not had a long ſucceſſion of Kings before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which remounts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the time where our common Chronology places the flood: inſomuch that ſeveral amongſt the Miſſionaries have thought it neceſſary to have recourſe to the Chronology of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> according to which the Deluge is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient by ſeveral Ages, than according to the common Chronology. What render'd the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory more probable, is, that under every King it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords the Eclipſes, and other celeſtial <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of his Reign: but <hi>Monſieur Caſſini</hi> having examined the time of a Conjunction of the Planets, which they place under their <hi>fifth</hi> King, he has found it above 500 years later than their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory makes it: and he proves this very miſreckoning of 500 years by another Aſtronomical remark, referred to the Reign of their <hi>ſeventh</hi> King. Thus the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Monarchy appears leſs ancient by 500 years than the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have thought, and it may be preſumed that in this ſucceſſion of Kings, which they give us, they have put thoſe who have reigned at the ſame time in diverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>China,</hi> when it was divided into ſeveral little Feudatary States under the ſame Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Monſieur Caſſini</hi> having given me his Reflexions upon this ſubject, I have thought fit to add them here, and once again to adorn my work with a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after his fancy. And becauſe he has communicated unto me a thought which he had about the ſitution of the <hi>Taprobane</hi> of the Ancients, I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to give it me: whatever reſpects the <hi>Indies</hi> being not improper in this Book, and whatever comes from <hi>Monſieur Caſſini</hi> being always well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>If the beginnings of the months do remove from this <hi>Epooha</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, it is eaſie to reſtore them after the obſervation of an Eclipſe of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>The order of the Common and Emboliſmick years, is regulated by the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of 60 years, in which 22 are Emboliſmick, and the others Common.</p>
                        <p>According to Father <hi>Martinius</hi> in his <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory, the years at the Moons Conjunction with the Sun, the neareſt the fifteenth degree of <hi>Aquarius:</hi> that is to ſay, the point of the Zodiack which is at equal diſtances from the points of the Winter Solſtice, and of the Vernal Equinox: which according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has been obſerved from the twenty fifth Age before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the preſent Age: tho this beginning has varied according to the will of diverſe Emperors, and that they have been obliged ſometimes to correct the year, from the Errors which were crept therein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="253" facs="tcp:98501:141"/>There may be more error in the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the years, than in the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the months, becauſe that the points of the Zodiack, which determine the firſt month of the year, are not immediately viſible, as the Eclipſes of the Sun, which determine the beginnings of the months.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, as Father <hi>Martinius</hi> remarks, that after a period of 60 luniſolar years, the Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun return not to the ſame point of the Zodiack, but that they anticipate three degrees, which the Sun runs through only in three days, which in ten periods of 60 years amount to 30 days. Thus to hinder the beginning of the year from removing above a Sign from the fifteenth degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> it would be neceſſary that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> ſhould add to every period of 600 years a month extraordinary, above the 22 months which are added to every period of 60 years. Yet Father <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> relates that they have no need of any intercalation: which I ſuppoſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand of theſe three days apart, but not of the extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalations of the months, when this difference of three days is mounted to an whole month.</p>

                        <p>BUt it is not known whether this be regularly practiſed, or whether the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> do add ſome months extraordinary to their years without rule, when they perceive that the beginning of the year is too remote from the middle of <hi>Aquarius;</hi> and whether the Intercalations of the months, as well ordinary as extraordinary, are made on purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>We have reaſon to doubt of what Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> who has been a long time in <hi>China,</hi> ſays in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Chronology, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> begin their years at the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun the neareſt the fifth degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> which muſt be ſo at preſent: So that from Father <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to the preſent <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years, they would have run back 30 degrees.</p>
                        <p>If the Obſervation related by Father <hi>Martinius</hi> in his ſeventh Book of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> was true, the beginning of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> year would be ſeveral Signs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the fifteenth degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> ſince the time that this degree has been aſſign'd for a middle limit of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years: for he ſays that according to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtorians, whoſe credit he ſuſpects, the 204<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year before the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the beginning of the year, five Planets appeared in the Conſtellation of <hi>Cing,</hi> which at preſent extends from the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the beginning of <hi>Leo,</hi> and then conſequently extended from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> to the ſame degrees of <hi>Cancer.</hi> It may be ſeen without any other calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this obſervation agrees not to the Syſtem of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years: for ſeeing that <hi>Mercury</hi> removes not from the Sun above 28 degrees, nor <hi>Venus</hi> above 48; it is certain that <hi>Venus</hi> could not be in the Conſtellation <hi>Cing,</hi> before that the Sun had paſſed half of the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> which is two whole Signs diſtant from the middle of <hi>Aquarius;</hi> and that <hi>Mercury</hi> could not appear in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation unleſs the Sun had paſſed the beginning of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and becauſe it was neceſſary that at leaſt one of theſe two Planets ſhould appear in this Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accompliſh the number of five, or both, if the Moon meet not therein: (for the Sun in this <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> could not be there) it is certain that the Sun could not be leſs remote from the middle of <hi>Aquarius</hi> than two whole Signs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year, at which this Conjunction is marked. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory remarks alſo, that at ſeveral times there is found ſome digreſſions in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years, which have obliged ſeveral Emperors to reſtore them to the firſt <hi>Epocha.</hi> Theſe digreſſions may have happened for having intercalated the months too frequently, or for having neglected the intercalations of the months when it was neceſſary to make them, and as we have not the Hiſtory of theſe intercalations, it is not poſſible to remove the perplexities which there is, for this cauſe, in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Chronology.</p>

                        <p>We have found by this compariſon, that every <hi>Chineſe</hi> Conſtellation begins ordinarily with ſome conſiderable fixed Star, which in the year 1628 is found in <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Catalogue almoſt always in the ſame minute, as the beginning of the correſponding Conſtellation in the two Catalogues of Father <hi>Martinius,</hi> except 3 or 4, in which it appears, that there is a miſtake of numbers in the two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues, where the diſtance taken from the point of the Equinox, accords not with the degrees and minutes of the Sign of the Zodiac, to which theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations are referred, as it agrees in the other Conſtellations.</p>

                        <p>This agreement of the numbers of theſe Tables with thoſe of <hi>Tycho,</hi> almoſt in the ſame minute, gave me ground to imagine that theſe Tables have been calculated by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who went about an Age ſince to <hi>China,</hi> and not by the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> For what probability is there, that without being drawn from <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Tables they ſhould be ſo conformable thereto? Our Aſtronomers of this Age find difficulty to agree in the ſame minute in the place of the fixed Stars: and it is known that between the Catalogues of <hi>Tycho,</hi> ane that of the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> made at the ſame time by excellent Aſtronomers, there is a difference of ſeveral minutes. Wherefore it is not very probable that the Obſervations of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> ſhould agree almoſt always with the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Tycho</hi> in the ſame minute.</p>

                           <hi>V.</hi> The Method of terminating the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Conſtellations at any time.</head>
                        <p>FAther <hi>Martinius</hi> remarks, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do determine the Longitude in the Heaven by the Poles of the World; that is to ſay by great Circles drawn through the Poles perpendicular to the Equinoxial, where we denote the right aſcenſions of the Stars. Therefore the ſtars which are between two Circles, that do paſs through the Poles, and through the two fixed Stars which terminate a conſtellation, relate to that very conſtellation.</p>
                        <p>But it appears by the compariſon of the two preceding Tables, that the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are not ſet down differently in the Table of Father <hi>Martinius</hi> from what they are noted in <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Table, which reduces the Stars to the Ecliptick, and not to the Equinoxial. They are not therefore ſet down after the <hi>Chineſe</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but to reduce them after the <hi>Chineſe</hi> method, it is neceſſary to refer the Stars which are at the beginning of every conſtellation to the Equinoxial, and to find their right aſcenſions, and the points of the Zodiack which ſhall have the ſame right aſcenſions, will be at the beginning of theſe conſtellations.</p>
                        <p>When a Star falls in the <hi>Colure</hi> of the Solſtices, as the foot of <hi>Gemini</hi> in that Table where begins the conſtellation <hi>Cing,</hi> there is no difference between its longitude after our manner, and its right aſcenſion, which is the longitude after the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> but as the Stars remove from the <hi>Colure</hi> of the Solſtices, the difference of their longitudes and of their right aſcenſions augments ſo much more, as the latitudes or declinations of the Stars are greater. And becauſe that the fixed Stars remove continually from one <hi>Colure</hi> and approach the other by a motion parallel to the Ecliptick, and oblique to the Equinoxial, this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence varies continually, and otherwiſe more conſtellation than in another: whence it happens that from one Age to the other the ſame <hi>Chineſe</hi> conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on determined by two fixed Stars enlarges, or contracts, and comprehends not always the ſame number of fixed Stars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="257" facs="tcp:98501:143"/>Therefore to know in what <hi>Chineſe</hi> conſtellation a Planet falls at a certain time, it is neceſſary to find for this time the right aſcenſion of the Planet, and the right aſcenſion of the fixed Stars adjoyning, which determine the beginning and end of the Conſtellations; which we ſhould not have known without the reflexion which we have made, that every Conſtellation begins with a certain fixed Star, and without the advice which Father <hi>Martinius</hi> gives us, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> longitudes are taken from the Poles of the world, that is to ſay, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from what they are ſet down in this Table.</p>
                        <p>It appears by this Table, that the Conſtellation <hi>Xe</hi> here treated of, begins with the firſt of the Wing of <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> and ends with the laſt of the ſame Wing, ſeeing that according to the ſecond Column of this very Table, this Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began in the year 1628, at 18 degrees and 20 minutes of <hi>Piſces,</hi> where we find at the ſame year the firſt of the Wing by <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Table reduced to the ſame time; tho the firſt Column of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Table gives two degrees leſs, which is doubtleſs an error of the impreſſion or calculation, which has crept into the two works of Father <hi>Martinius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Originals of the Tables of <hi>Tycho</hi> and <hi>Longimontanus</hi> do likewiſe give the laſt of the Wing at 4 degrees and a minute of <hi>Aries,</hi> where ends the Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Xe,</hi> and where begins the following Conſtellation <hi>Pi,</hi> though the <hi>Rodolphine</hi> and <hi>Philolaick</hi> Tables with thoſe of Father <hi>Ricciolus</hi> do ſhow the ſame Star at 4 degrees of <hi>Piſces,</hi> which certainly is an error of the Tranſcribers, which is ſlipt into the works of theſe Aſtronomers. As theſe two Stars have a great Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern longitude, the firſt being 19 degrees and 26 minutes, the ſecond 12 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 35 minutes; the difference between their longitude and their right aſcenſion, which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> take for longitude, is conſiderable at preſent, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as theſe Stars are near the <hi>Colure</hi> of the Equinoxes, where this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is greater than elſewhere. But it was not ſo conſiderable anciently, when theſe Stars were near the <hi>Colure</hi> of the Solſtices.</p>

                        <p>HAving reduced theſe Stars to the Equinoxial in the twenty fourth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth Age before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we have not found, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Circles of the declinations which paſs through theſe Stars, five Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets could be found joyned together, neither in theſe Ages, nor in two others before and after, whilſt that the Sun was in the ſign of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory imports.</p>
                        <p>But we have found that <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> met in that <hi>Chineſe</hi> conſtellation determined by this method, the Sun being in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> in the 2012 year before the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> according to the <hi>Julian,</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> according to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> form, which runs at preſent, and that the day following 10/27 of <hi>February</hi> at 6 a Clock in the morning at <hi>China,</hi> happen'd the conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, which may be that which was taken as the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> years.</p>
                        <p>Then according to the Catalogue of <hi>Tycho,</hi> and the motion which he gives to the fixed Stars, the firſt of the wing of <hi>Pegaſus</hi> from which began the conſtellation <hi>Xe,</hi> was at 26 degrees 50 minutes of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the Circle of its declination cut the Ecliptick at 24 degrees of the ſame ſign.</p>
                        <p>The laſt of the wing of <hi>Pagaſus</hi> was at 12 degrees and a half of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and its Circle of Declination cut the Ecliptick, and carry'd it back to the eleventh degree of the ſame ſign.</p>

And in 24 hours or thereabouts happened the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Chronology places the Conjunction of the Planets between the 2513 and 2435 years before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There will be therefore a difference of 5 Ages between the time denoted by this Chronology and the true time.

                           <hi>VII.</hi> An Ancient Obſervation of a Winter Solſtice made at <hi>China.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THis difference of five Age whereby it appears according to this calculation, that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do make their <hi>Epocha</hi> too antient, is confirmed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of Father <hi>Martinius</hi> his Hiſtory, where this Author reports that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Jao</hi> the ſeventh Emperor of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> the Winter Solſtice was obſerved about the firſt degree of the conſtellation <hi>Hiu,</hi> which at preſent begins about the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> ſo that ſince this time the Solſtice is removed above 48 degrees from its firſt place; he refers this Obſervation to the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Jao,</hi> which he reports to have been the 2341 before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It appears by the Table that this conſtellation <hi>Hiu</hi> began with the Star which is in the left ſhoulder of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> which in the year 1628 was at 18 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, 16 Minutes of <hi>Aquarius;</hi> but the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Jao</hi> it was in 29 degrees of <hi>Sagitarius</hi> and ſome minutes, ſeeing that the Winter Solſtice, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the beginning of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> was at the firſt of the conſtellation <hi>Hiu.</hi> The diſtance between theſe two places of the Zodiac is 49 degrees 16 minutes, which the fixed Stars according to <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Table do make in 3478 years, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of 51 ſeconds <hi>per annum:</hi> from whence having deducted 1625 years at moſt, which are elapſed from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jao</hi> would be the 1852 year before the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> which Father <hi>Martinius</hi> according to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory placeth in the 2347<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year before <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> making it more antient by about 497 years. Thus there are about 5 Ages difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this <hi>Epocha</hi> taken from the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtory, and the ſame drawn from the motion of the fixed Stars made in this interval of time, as we have found by the Examination of the Obſervation of the 5 Planets in the Conſtellation <hi>Xe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>According to Father</hi> Martinius <hi>in the beginning of his History of</hi> China, <hi>it ſeems that the</hi> Chineſes <hi>do reckon but five Planets,</hi> Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, <hi>and</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, <hi>and that they ſuppoſe at the time of their fifth Emperor, the concourſe of thoſe five Planets in the Conſtellation</hi> Xe, <hi>on the ſame day that there was a Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. But if this</hi> Chineſe <hi>obſervation muſt be thus underſtood, 'twould be a meer groundleſs miſtake: ſuch a concourſe having not happened at the time denoted by the</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes, <hi>nor long before it, ſo that it cannot be known perhaps how to take it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Hiſtorians ſupported with Aſtronomical Obſervations, do merit therefore to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined beforc that credit be given thereunto. Thus an account of Eclipſes, which is at the beginning of</hi> Diogenes Laertius, <hi>and which he relates after</hi> Sotion, <hi>is condemned as falſe by Monſieur</hi> Caſſini. Sotion <hi>reckoned</hi> 48863 <hi>years between</hi> Vulcan <hi>and</hi> Alexander <hi>the</hi> Great, <hi>and in this interval he placed</hi> 373 <hi>ſolar Eclipſes, and</hi> 832 <hi>lunar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A too ready belief muſt not likewiſe be given to an History, becauſe it gives us a well ranged ſucceſſion of Kings. The</hi> Perſians <hi>do give us one of this Nature, which we know to be full of falſities: and we have the Genealogies of our Kings from</hi> Adam, <hi>which are yet more ſpurious. 'Tis not only from a well adjusted ſucceſſion, that the Hiſtories to which we give credit, do take their certainty, but from that they are confirmed one by the other: All the Nations that can have a knowledge of the ſame things, relating them after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at leaſt as to the moſt important circumſtances, ſo that where there is a diverſity of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98501:144"/>
advice we fall into doubt. The Hiſtory of the</hi> Chineſes <hi>has neither been contradicted, nor confirmed by their Neighbours: no Authority can be drawn from their ſilence; and thus all that we have to do, is to believe it true in the groſs, eſpecially from about</hi> 200 <hi>years before Jeſus Chriſt; but not in what oppugns our Hiſtories, which are better atteſted than theirs.</hi>

                     <head>Concerning the Iſle <hi>Taprobane,</hi> by Monſieur <hi>Caſſini.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE ſituation of the Iſle <hi>Taprobane,</hi> according to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in the ſeventh Book of his Geography, was over againſt the Promontary <hi>Cari.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Promontary is placed by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> between the Rivers <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> nearer <hi>Indus</hi> than the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Iſle <hi>Taprobane</hi> was divided by the Equinoxial Line into two unequal parts, the greateſt of which was in the Northern Hemiſphere, extending to 12 or 13 degrees of Northern Latitude. The leaſt part was in the Southern Hemiſphere, extending to two degrees and a half of Southern Latitude.</p>
                     <p>Round about this Iſland there were 1378 little Iſles, among which there were 19 more conſiderable, the name of which was known in the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>The Promontory <hi>Cory</hi> could be no other than that, which is at preſent called <hi>Comori,</hi> or <hi>Comorin,</hi> which is alſo between the <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> nearer the <hi>Indus</hi> than the <hi>Ganges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Over againſt this Cape there is not at preſent ſo great an Iſle as <hi>Taprobane,</hi> which could be divided by the Equinoxial, and environed with 1378 Iſles: but there is a multitude of little Iſles, called <hi>Maldivae,</hi> which the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be to the number of 12 Thouſand. According to the Relation of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> who lived there five years, theſe Iſles have a King, who aſſumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Title of King of 13 Provinces, and 12 Thouſand Iſles.</p>
                     <p>Every one of theſe thirteen Provinces is an heap of little Iſles, each of which is environed with a great bank of Stone, which incloſes it all round like a great wall: they are called <hi>Attolons.</hi> They have each Thirty miles in circumference, a little more or leſs, and are of a figure almoſt round, or oval. They are end to end one from the other, from the North to the South; and they are ſeparated by Channels of the Sea, ſome broad, others very narrow, Theſe Stone-banks which environ every <hi>Attollon,</hi> are ſo high, and the Sea breaks there with ſuch an impetuoſity, that they which are in the middle of an <hi>Attollon,</hi> do ſee theſe banks all round, with the Waves of the Sea which ſeem as high as the Houſes. The Incloſure of an <hi>Attollon</hi> has but 4 Avenues, two on the North-ſide, two others on the South-ſide, one of which is at the Eaſt, the other at the Weſt, and the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of which is 200 paces, the narroweſt ſomewhat leſs than 30. At the two ſides of each of theſe Avenues there are ſome Iſles, but the Currents and great Tides do daily diminiſh the number thereof. <hi>Pirard</hi> adds, that to ſee the inſide of one of theſe <hi>Attollons,</hi> one would ſay that all theſe little Iſles and the Channels of the Sea, which it incloſes, are only a continued plain, and that it was antiently only a ſingle Iſland, cut and divided afterwards into ſeveral. Every where almoſt is ſeen the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Channels, which divide them, ſo ſhallow they are, except in ſome places: and when the Sea is low, the water reaches not up to the girdle, but to the middle of the leg almoſt every where.</p>
                     <p>There is a violent and perpetual Current, which from the month of <hi>April</hi> to the month of <hi>October</hi> comes impetuouſly from the Weſt, and cauſes the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rains which do there make the Winter; and at the other ſix months the Winds are fixed from the Eaſt, and do bring a great heat, without any rain, which cauſes their Summer. At the bottom of theſe Channels, there are great Stones, which the Inhabitants do uſe to build with, and they are alſo ſtored with a kind of Buſhes, which reſemble Coral; which renders the paſſage of the Boats through theſe Channels extreamly difficult.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:98501:145"/>
                        <hi>Linſcoten</hi> teſtifies that according to the <hi>Mallabars,</hi> theſe little Iſles have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been joyned to the firm Land, and that by the ſucceſſion of time they have been looſed thence by the Violence of the Sea, by reaſon of the lowneſs of the Land.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore probable that the <hi>Maldivae</hi> are a remainder of the great Iſland <hi>Taprobane;</hi> and of the 1378 Iſlands which did encompaſs it, which have been carryed away, or diminiſhed by the Currents, there remaining nothing elſe but theſe Rocks, which muſt formerly be the baſes of the Mountains: and what remains in the incloſure of theſe Rocks, where the Sea daſhes ſo, that it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable only of dividing, but not of carrying away the Lands which are included within their Circuit.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that theſe Iſles have the ſame ſituation in regard of the Equinoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Promontory, and of the Rivers <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> aſſigns to ſeveral places of the Iſle <hi>Taprobane.</hi>
